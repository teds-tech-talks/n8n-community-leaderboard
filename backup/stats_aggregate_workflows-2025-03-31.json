spreadsheet.\n\n![workflow-screenshot](fileId:468)\n\n**Set node:** The Set node is used to generate data that we want to add to Google Sheets. Depending on your use-case you might have data coming from a different source. For example, you might be fetching data from a WebHook call. Add the node that will fetch the data that you want to add to the Google Sheet.\nUse can then use the Set node to set the data that you want to add to the Google Sheets.\n\n**Google Sheets node:** This node will add the data from the Set node in a new row to the Google Sheet. You will have to enter the Spreadsheet ID and the Range to specify which sheet you want to add the data to.\n\n**Google Sheets1 node:** This node looks for a specific value in the Google Sheet and returns all the rows that contain the value. In this example, we are looking for the value Berlin in our Google Sheet. If you want to look for a different value, enter that value in the ***Lookup Value*** field, and specify the column in the ***Lookup Column*** field.\n\n**Set1 node:** The Set node sets the value of the rent by $100 for the houses in Berlin. We pass this new data to the next nodes in the workflow.\n\n**Google Sheets2 node:** This node will update the rent for the houses in Berlin with the new rent set in the previous node. We are mapping the rows with their ID. Depending on your use-case, you might want to map the values with a different column. To set this enter the column name in the ***Key*** field.\n\n**Google Sheets3 node:** This node returns the information from the Google Sheet. You can specify the columns that should get returned in the ***Range*** field. Currently, the node fetches the data for columns A to D.

channel.\n\n![workflow-screenshot](fileId:346)\n\n**Typeform Trigger node:** Whenever a user submits a response to the Typeform, the Typeform Trigger node will trigger the workflow. The node returns the response that the user has submitted in the form.\n\n**Google Cloud Natural Language node:** This node analyses the sentiment of the response the user has provided and gives a score.\n\n**IF node:** The IF node uses the score provided by the Google Cloud Natural Language node and checks if the score is negative (smaller than 0). If the score is negative we get the result as True, otherwise False.\n\n**Mattermost node:** If the score is negative, the IF node returns true and the true branch of the IF node is executed. We connect the Mattermost node with the true branch of the IF node. Whenever the score of the sentiment analysis is negative, the node gets executed and a message is posted on a channel in Mattermost.\n\n**NoOp:** This node here is optional, as the absence of this node won't make a difference to the functioning of the workflow.\n\nThis workflow can be used by Product Managers to analyze the feedback of the product. The workflow can also be used by HR to analyze employee feedback. You can even use this node for sentiment analysis of Tweets.\n\nTo perform a sentiment analysis of Tweets, replace the Typeform Trigger node with the Twitter node.\n\n***Note:*** You will need a Trigger node or Start node to start the workflow.\n\nInstead of posting a message on Mattermost, you can save the results in a database or a Google Sheet, or Airtable. Replace the Mattermost node with (or add after the Mattermost node) the node of your choice to add the result to your database. \n\nYou can learn to build this workflow on the documentation page of the [Google Cloud Natural Language](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googleCloudNaturalLanguage/#google-cloud-natural-language)

choosing).  These can then be shared through your entire org and used to track changes (if you make any sad 'oopsies'.\n\n## Flow\n\n1. Obtains and creates listing of currently configured workflows.\n2. Iterates through each workflow looking at the following\n\t1. Github source (if present)\n\t2. Actual workflow code (from N8N)\n3. Workflow code is sorted and compared for any changes\n4. If changed (or new) the workflows are saved / archived into github.\n\n## Configuration\n\nMost of the configuration is done in the `Globals` node which houses the repo detail for github nodes.  The only other dependency is that it by default looks for a `GitHub` credential, if you use something other than that precise wording you will need to change the credential used on the respective nodes.  We gave it 'Manage' rights, but that was only so that it was able to override a requirement for checks to complete?  Most would probably only need 'Write' privileges.\n\n## Background\n\nWell, so we initially started using N8N just as a kubernetes-based service housed with its DB running inside the pod.  Worked great for getting to know N8N and we jut kept all our workflows and credentials listed in a readme.  Fast forward about a year...\n\nWe have migrated this into our 'production' toolsets and maintain a bunch of team worflows inside it (not company-wide, but LOTS of team fun).  While trying to spin a copy of our production RDS database, the ++actual++ production database was deleted, and in doing so AWS was nice enough to wipe our snapshots too!! Yea!\n\nThankfully it only took us a few hours to get everything back up and running thanks to this, so I'm sharing it for everyone to benefit.  We have used it to restore old workflows, changes, and now to test our full DR proceedures!

For example, a **Google Sheets** or **Airtable** sheet, a **.CSV** file, or any relational database like **MySQL**. \n\nGenerally, you need to ensure that you send well-formatted data into the Spreadsheet or Database node. You can use the [Set](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/#set) or [Function](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function/#function) node to transform data into the correct format for your destination.\n\n![key_to_table.png](fileId:435)\n\n## Key concepts\n- Spreadsheets and databases have columns, like \"Name\" and \"Email\". The data you send into a Spreadsheet/ Database node needs to match these column names for each row of data that you want to insert. Data points need to be represented as key-value pairs. Specifically, each item of data needs to have a JSON key for each column in the sheet. For a spreadsheet with \"Name\" and \"Email\" columns, it would look like: **{\"Name\" : \"Karla\", \"Email\" : \"karla@email.com\"}**\n\n- Before appending or inserting data to a spreadsheet or database, you might need to transform it into the correct format. You can preprocess the data with a [Set](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/#set) or [Function](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function/#function) node. The Set node allows you to perform simple transforms when the data you want to load into spreadsheet rows is already represented as items. Use the Function node when you need to map nested data (like arrays) inside a single item to their own top-level items ([Example in community forums](https://community.n8n.io/t/getting-all-items-from-trello-api-call/4567/8)).\n- Spreadsheet and database nodes in n8n perform their configured action (like **Append**, **Create Row**, **Write to File**) on each item of input data. \n\n\n\n## Workflow walkthrough\n\n[![homepage](https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/eb87068f35a14af095f7b0f020b62211-with-play.jpg)](https://www.loom.com/share/eb87068f35a14af095f7b0f020b62211)\n","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":4,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.function":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Max Tkacz","username":"maxt","bio":"Design @ n8n","verified":true,"links":["https://n8n.io"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/4eca9c29591ed5132a4c192e7447d9a42f5ae70f6ca2dbf89c15113e195a810b?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":980,"template_name":"Load data into spreadsheet or database","unique_visitors":1677,"unique_weekly_visitors":1,"unique_monthly_visitors":279,"unique_inserters":64,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":8},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/982","wf_detais":{"id":982,"name":"Gender inclusive language bot for Mattermost","createdAt":"2021-03-15T08:58:33.146Z","description":"This workflow ensures gender inclusive language in Mattermost channels.

In the example, it's the `.`, and the repository name is `repo`. Change it in the commands *and in the workflow commands* (you can set it as a variable in the wokflow). Checkout to another branch if you won't use the master one.\n\n```\ncd .\ngit clone repository\n```\n\nOr you could `git init` and then add the remote (`git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL`), whatever pleases you more.\n\nAs the server, check if everything is ok for beeing able to commit. Very likely you'll need to setup the user email and name. Try to create a commit, and push it to upstream, and everything you need (like config a user to comit) will appear in way. I strong suggest testing with exporting the commands to garantee it will work too.\n\n```\ncd ./repo\n\ngit commit -c \"Initial commmit\" --allow-empty\n```\n\n-u is the same as --set-upstream\n\n```sh \ngit push -u origin master \n```\n\nTesting to push to upstream with the first exported data\n\n```\nnpx n8n export:workflow --backup --output ./repo/workflows/\nnpx n8n export:credentials --backup --output repo/credentials/\n\ncd ./repo\ngit add .\ngit commit -c \"manual backup: first export\"\ngit push\n```\n\nAfter that, if everything is ok, the workflow should work just fine.\n\n## Adjustments\n\nAdjust the path in used in the workflow. See the the `git -C PATH` command is the same as `cd PATH; git ...`.\n\nAlso, adjust the cron to run as you need. As I said in the beginning, you can run it even for every minute, but it will create commits only when there are changes.\n\n### Credentials encryption\n\nThe default for exporting the credentials is to do them encrypted. You can add the flag `--decrypted` to the `n8n export:credentials` command if you need to save them in plain.

The workflow will save this song in a playlist called `June '24`. If this playlist does not exist, the workflow will create it for me.\n\n## ⚙ How it works\nEach 5 minutes, the workflow will start automatically. He will do 3 things :\n1. Get the last 10 songs you saved in the \"Liked song\" playlist (by clicking on the heart in the app) and save them in a NocoDB table (of course, the workflow avoid to create duplicates).\n2. Check if the monthly playlist is already created. Otherwise, the playlist is created. The created playlist is also saved in NocoDB to avoid any problems.\n3. Check if the monthly playlist contains all the song liked this month by getting them from NocoDB. If they are not present, add them one by one in the playlist.\n\nYou may have a question regarding the need of NocoDB. Over the last few weeks/months, I've had duplication problems in my playlists and some playlists have been created twice because Spotify wasn't returning all the information but only partial information.\nHaving the database means I don't have to rely on Spotify's data but on my own, which is accurate and represents reality.\n\n## 📝 Prerequisites\nYou need to have :\n- Spotify API keys, which you can obtain by creating a Spotify application here: [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).\n- Create a NocoDB API token\n\n## 📚 Instructions\n1. Follow the [instructions below](https://n8n.io/workflows/1074#instructions)\n2. Create your Spotify API credential\n3. Create your NocoDB credential\n4. Populate all Spotify nodes with your credentials\n5. Populate all Spotify nodes with your credentials\n6.

To do so: open the `Start download` node and edit the Credentials. \n\n![image.png](fileId:581)\n\nPerform the same operation choosing the new credentials also in node `Start download new token`.\nIn this automation we call transmission twice due to a security protocol in transmission system that prevents single click commands to be triggered, performing the request twice bypasses this security mechanism. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)\nWe use the `X-Transmission-Session-Id` provided by the first request to authenticate the second request.\n\n### Telegram\nIn order to make the workflow work as expected you must create a telegram bot and configure the nodes (`Torrent not found` and `Telegram1`) to send your message once the workflow is complete. \nHere's an easy guide to follow [https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/)\nIn those nodes you also should configure the Chat ID, you may use your telegram username or use a bot to retrieve your id.\nYou may chat with [useridinfobot](https://t.me/useridinfobot) that sends you your id.\n\n## Ok google automation\n\nSince right now we do not have a n8n client for mobile that can trigger automation using google assistant I decided to use an IFTTT automation to trigger the webhook.\n\nI connect my IFTTT account with google assistant and pick the trigger.\n`Say a phrase with a text ingredient` as in the picture below.\n\n![image.png](fileId:582)\n\nAnd configure the trigger this way.\n`scarica $` -&gt; `download $`\nor\n`metti in download $` -&gt; `put in download $`\n\nor some other trigger you may want.\n\n![image.png](fileId:580)\n\nThen configure your server to trigger the webhook of n8n.\n\n![image.png](fileId:579)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion we provide a fully working automation that integrates in n8n a node library and provides an easy trigger to perform a complex operation.\n\n### Security concern\nGiving the ability to trigger a download may be problematic for potential unwanted torrent malware download, so you may decide to authenticate the webhook request passing in the body another field with a shared token between the two endpoints.\n\nMoreover the `torrent-search-api` library and its dependencies have some vulnerability that you may want to avoid on your own media-center, this will hopefully be patched soon in a further release of the library.\n\nThis is just an interesting proof of concept.\n\n### Quality of the download\n\nYou may want to introduce another block between torrent search and webhook trigger to search for a movie based on the words detected by google assistant, sometimes it misinterprets something and you may end up downloading potential copyrighted material.\nPlease use this automation only for free and open source movies and music.\n\n\n","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":9,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.functionItem":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Danger","username":"dangerblack","bio":null,"verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/56c18ac3eda0e3a9c1981f99325738e5623c892837c0c5c14e9697209661f386?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1381,"template_name":"Search and download torrents using transmission-daemon","unique_visitors":753,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":109,"unique_inserters":103,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":14},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1387","wf_detais":{"id":1387,"name":"Send automated daily reminders on Telegram","createdAt":"2022-01-08T22:38:50.531Z","description":"A goal for 2022 is to write 1 thing I do each day.

Additionally I opted to include to change the colour of Philips Hue lamp located in my living room where my wife is currently working so she know's if she can interrupt me or not.\n\nMy calendar is built on the theory behind the [Diary Detox](https://diarydetox.com/) system and as such the Slack Status reflect the colours involved. This was achieved using the emote aliases for the relevant colour circles.\n\n![4DW Colours.png](fileId:602)\n\nThe Philips Hue lamp status is changed via the local API with Home Assistant. This is a very similiar process to controlling it with something like the Streamdeck, but the workflow calls the Webhook instead of the Streamdeck. This process can be found in lots of Youtube videos such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI328yziiZs).\n\nThis gives my wife a very quick and easy way to know if she can interrupt me in my office (when the lights are Green or Blue) or when I'm busy (Red).\n\n![RedGreenLight.png](fileId:603)\n\n**Please Note:** The above images are not intended to be an incentive to create your own Squid Games.\n\nAdditionally, when integrating Slack with N8N, there are 2 x APIs which can be used. Typically the Bot User OAuth Token is used, however in order for your Status to be updated, the **User OAuth Token** must be used with the *users.profile:read* and *users.profile:write* permissions enabled.\n\nFor clarity, I have removed the Webhooks from the Workflow as this would allow any person to control my lights. These can be inserted in the HTTP Request nodes. Each node responds to a different automation within the Home Assistant infrastructure.\n\n*Acknowledgement: I would also credit Jon (Discord) aka 8668 (Workflows) for writing the Function node which turns the ColorID into a named variable.*","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.function":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleCalendar":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleCalendarTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"TheUnknownEntity","username":"theunknownentity","bio":null,"verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/fdfd7bebdaab5d5e3fd667a7f543df5f191deef57cad901af3fbe6767da59ccd?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1420,"template_name":"Google Calendar to Slack Status and Philips Hue","unique_visitors":404,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":80,"unique_inserters":49,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":7},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1423","wf_detais":{"id":1423,"name":"Tiny Tiny RSS new stared article saved to wallabag ","createdAt":"2022-02-02T23:18:21.292Z","description":"Every 10 minutes check if a new article was stared, if so, save it in wallabag to read it later.","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":10,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.cron":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.function":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"dev","username":"tyjak","bio":null,"verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/c7e3da5f1b0460589c52e4275fd4435c03735c865e4141d98dbc49e3935f8e8e?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1423,"template_name":"Tiny Tiny RSS new stared article saved to wallabag ","unique_visitors":130,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":32,"unique_inserters":49,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":9},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1425","wf_detais":{"id":1425,"name":"Send a random recipe once a day to Telegram","createdAt":"2022-02-03T07:38:45.132Z","description":"This telegram bot is designed to send one random recipe a day. \n\nThis specific bot has filtered out only vegan recipes, so you can choose your diet type and send only recipes for a specific diet. \n\nWhat credentials you need:\n- Set up a [telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots).\n- Airtable for listing who has joined your bot.

Here are some quick tips for making changes to the form.\n\n### Webform Nodes\nThere are two nodes that control what you see in the form:\n- *Create Shopper Form* - displays the form and submits it to the correct webhook\n- *Create Response Page* - displays the results when the form is submitted\n\n### Editing the Webform\nThe easiest way that I have found to edit the webform is to:\n1. Open up the Set node (*Create Shopper Form* or *Create Response Page*) that contains the HTML you wish to edit.\n2. Copy the contents of the HTML value to your favourite HTML editor\n3. Make your changes\n4. Paste the updated HTML back into the Set node\n\n### Changing the Webhook URL the Webform Posts To\nIn order for the webform to work properly, do the following:\n1. Determine the Production URL for the *Submit Shopper* webhook node\n2. In the *Create Shopper Form* node, look for the following line in the HTML value:\n`form action=\"https://tephlon.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/submit-shopper\" method=\"POST\"`\n3. Replace `https://tephlon.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/submit-shopper` with your Production URL\n\n### Changing the Webform Image\nThe image that is in the webform is actually embedded in the HTML in each of the *Create Shopper Form* or *Create Response Page* Set nodes and can be modified from there using these steps:\n1. Open up the appropriate Set node\n2. In the HTML value, find the line that starts with `background-image:`. It will be followed by a long string that looks like random characters\n3.

Not a Sendgrid user? Simply remove the Sendgrid node and add a Gmail node instead. The stock exchange has a REST API?

In our table, we’ll track all information needed to identify each investment product:\n\n![image.png](fileId:660)\n\nWe have two text type columns (**Name** and **ISIN**) as well as two number type columns (**Count** and **Purchase Price**).\n\n# Workflow\n\n![image.png](fileId:661)\n\n## Nodes\n\n### 1. Cron\n\nThe Cron node will trigger our workflow to run each work day in the morning hours.\n\n### 2. Baserow\n\nThe Baserow node will fetch our investments from the database table shown above.\n\n### 3. HTTP Request\n\nUsing the HTTP Request node we can fetch live data from the stock exchange of our choice based on the ISIN. This example uses Tradegate, which is used by many German fintechs. The basic approach should also work for other exchanges, as long as they provide the required data to the public.\n\n### 4. HTML Extract\n\nSince our HTTP Request node fetches full websites, we’re using the HTML Extract node to extract the information we’re looking for from each website. If an exchange other than Tradegate is used, the selectors used in this node will most likely need to be updated.\n\n### 5. + 6. Set\n\nThe Set nodes helps with setting the exact columns we’ll use in our table. In this case we’re first formatting the results from our exchange, then calculate the changes based on the purchase price.\n\n### 7. Function\n\nHere were using a bit of Javascript magic to build an HTML email. This is where any changes to the email content would have to be made.\n\n### 8. Sendgrid\n\nFinally we send out the email built in the previous step. This is where you can configure sender and recipients.\n\n# Result\n\nThe basic email generated by this workflow will look like so:\n\n![image.png](fileId:659)","categories":[{"id":8,"name":"Finance"},{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":9,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.cron":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.baserow":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.function":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.sendGrid":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.htmlExtract":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Tom","username":"mutedjam","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["https://github.com/that-one-tom/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/7a3710173e907baffaf7ed7ebffc37955c9cdeadb8612200225a34a2e056aa17?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1785,"template_name":"Track investments using Baserow and n8n","unique_visitors":1726,"unique_weekly_visitors":2,"unique_monthly_visitors":350,"unique_inserters":198,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":29},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1787","wf_detais":{"id":1787,"name":"Upload leads from a CSV file to Pipedrive CRM","createdAt":"2022-09-09T11:43:13.319Z","description":"This workflow gets leads' contacts from a CSV file and adds it to the Pipedrive CRM by creating an organization and a person.

It starts with either a form submission or a webhook trigger, allowing users to input data, URLs or IPs that require analysis. The workflow then splits into two paths depending on whether the input data is an IP or URL. If an IP was given, it sets the ip variable to the IP; however if a URL was given the workflow will perform a DNS lookup using Google Public DNS and sets the ip variable based on the results from Google.\n\nThe workflow then checks the obtained IP addresses against GreyNoise services, with one branch utilizing GreyNoise RIOT IP Lookup to assess IP reputation and association with known benign services, and the other using GreyNoise IP Context to evaluate potential threats. The results from both GreyNoise services are merged to create a comprehensive analysis which includes the IP, classification (benign, malicious, or unknown), IP location, tags to identify activity or malware, category, and trust level. \n\nIn parallel, a VirusTotal scan is initiated for the URL/IP to identify if it is malicious. A 5-second wait ensures proper processing, and the workflow subsequently polls the scan result to determine when the analysis is complete. The workflow then summarizes the analysis including the overall security vendor analysis results, blockList analysis, OpenPhish analysis, the URL, and the IP.\n\nFinally, the workflow combines the summarized intelligence from both GreyNoise and VirusTotal to provide a thorough analysis of the URL/IP. This summarized intelligence can then be emailed to the user that filled out the form via Gmail or it can be sent to the user via a Slack message.\n\nSetting up this workflow may require proper configuration of the form submission or webhook trigger, and ensuring that the GreyNoise and VirusTotal API credentials are correctly integrated. Users should also consider the potential volume of data and API rate limits, as excessive requests could lead to issues. Proper documentation and validation of input data are crucial to ensure accurate and meaningful results in the final report.","categories":[{"id":29,"name":"SecOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":29,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.itemLists":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":5}}}},"user":{"name":"n8n Team","username":"n8n-team","bio":"Meet the official n8n team.

It then sends a summarized Slack message to report details about the analyzed email, including the subject, sender, date, URLScan report URL, and VirusTotal verdict for URLs that were reported as malicious.\n\nPotential issues during setup include configuring the Outlook node to retrieve unread messages, resolving a configuration issue in the VirusTotal node, and handling authentication and API keys for both URLScan.io and VirusTotal nodes. Additionally, proper error handling and testing with various email content types and URLs are essential to ensure the workflow accurately identifies IOCs and reports them to the Slack channel.\n","categories":[{"id":29,"name":"SecOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":23,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.urlScanIo":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.microsoftOutlook":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"n8n Team","username":"n8n-team","bio":"Meet the official n8n team.

It can be initiated either manually from within the n8n UI for testing or automatically triggered by a webhook when a new login event occurs.\n\nThe workflow first extracts relevant data from the incoming webhook payload, including the IP address, user agent, timestamp, URL, and user ID. It then splits into three parallel processing paths.\n\nIn the first path, it queries GreyNoise's Community API to retrieve information about the investigated IP address. Depending on the classification and trust level received from GreyNoise, the alert is given a High, Medium, or Low priority. This priority is assigned based on the best practices documentation from GreyNoise on how to apply their data to analysis. Once a priority is assigned, a message is sent to a Slack channel to notify users about the alert.\n\nThe second path involves fetching geolocation data about the IP address using IP-API's Geolocation API and merging it with data from the UserParser node. This data is then combined with the data obtained from GreyNoise.\n\nIn the third path, the UserParser node queries the Userparser IP address and user agent lookup API to obtain information about the user's IP and user agent. This data is merged with the IP-API data and GreyNoise data.\n\nThe workflow then checks if the IP address is considered an unknown threat by examining both the noise and riot fields from GreyNoise. If it is considered an unknown threat, the workflow proceeds to retrieve the last 10 login records for the same user from a Postgres database.\n\nIf there are any discrepancies in the login information, indicating a new location or device/browser, the user is informed via email.\n\nPotential issues when setting up this workflow include ensuring that credentials are correctly entered for GreyNoise and UserParser nodes, and addressing any discrepancies in the data sources that could lead to false positives or negatives in threat detection. Additionally, the usage of hardcoded API keys should be replaced with credentials for security and flexibility. Thorough testing and validation with sample data are crucial to ensure the workflow performs as expected and aligns with security incident response procedures.","categories":[{"id":29,"name":"SecOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":43,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.html":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.postgres":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":10},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"n8n Team","username":"n8n-team","bio":"Meet the official n8n team.

Sometimes we are not able to access a PC to resolve an issue if something goes wrong with a workflow. If you, like me, use Telegram to send yourself error reports, you can quickly react in case of urgency. Just by sending '/stop' combined with the name you use for a workflow, you can deactivate a workflow, or reactivate it with '/start'. For example '/stop marketing'.\n\nWalkthrough: [https://watch.screencastify.com/v/uWQ88gZKj57WTGOOqSW2](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/uWQ88gZKj57WTGOOqSW2) (6min)\n\n## Instructions\n1. Create a Telegram API key through botfather ([https://t.me/botfather](https://t.me/botfather)). Add it to the telegram credentials.\n2. For the N8N nodes, go to settings in your n8n instance. Then 'n8n API' and 'create an API key'. \n3. To ensure that only we can send commands to the bot, we need the chat ID of our DM with our newly created bot. Open the the Telegram trigger and click on 'listen to events'.\n4. Go to Telegram and send a direct message to the bot, this will trigger the Telegram node.\n5. Go to the filter node and fill in the chat id you want to filter for with the data you got from the test event in the Telegram node.\n6. In the first Switch node you can find the commands, in this case it is '/start' and '/stop'. When you send a message to your bot starting with either of those, it will go to the next switch nodes.\n7. Next it will check what other word it contains. As an example I have used the words 'marketing' and 'sales', both corresponding to a marketing and sales workflow. \n8. The last nodes will either activate or deactivate a workflow.","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":12,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.n8n":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.telegramTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"MilanWR","username":"milanwr","bio":null,"verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/250cc11c9a8bb778dcc43c7b21112f5ffbb438820be9c4ceb57a188bcd44dc69?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1999,"template_name":"(De)activate n8n workflows using Telegram commands","unique_visitors":557,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":107,"unique_inserters":152,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":15},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2006","wf_detais":{"id":2006,"name":"AI agent that can scrape webpages","createdAt":"2023-12-06T14:45:11.358Z","description":"![n8nReAct.webp](fileId:720)\n\n⚙️🛠️🚀🤖🦾\n\nThis template is a PoC of a ReAct AI Agent capable of fetching random pages (not only Wikipedia or Google search results).\n\nOn the top part there's a manual chat node connected to a LangChain ReAct Agent.

It is designed to alert users when inventory levels are low or out of stock, integrating with Shopify's webhook system and providing notifications through Discord (can be changed to any messaging platform) with product images and details.\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\nWebhook Node (Shopify Listener): This node is set up to listen for Shopify's inventory level webhook. It triggers the workflow whenever there is an update in the inventory levels. The webhook is configured in Shopify settings, where the n8n URL is specified to receive inventory level updates.\n\nFunction Node (Inventory Check): This node processes the data received from the Shopify webhook. It extracts the available inventory and the inventory item ID, and determines whether the inventory is low (less than 4 items) or out of stock.\n\nCondition Nodes (Inventory Level Check): Two condition nodes follow the function node. One checks if the inventory is low (low_inventory equals true), and the other checks if the inventory is out of stock (out_of_stock equals true).\n\nGraphQL Node (Product Details Retrieval): Connected to the condition nodes, this node fetches detailed information about the product using Shopify's GraphQL API. It retrieves the product variant, title, current inventory quantity, and the first product image.\n\nHTTP Node (Discord Notification): The final node in the workflow sends a notification to Discord. It includes an embed with the product title, a warning message (\"This product is running out of stock!\"), the remaining inventory quantity, product variant details, and the product image. The notification ensures that relevant stakeholders are immediately informed about critical inventory levels.","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":15,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.graphql":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"siyad","username":"salsiy","bio":"","verified":false,"links":["https://www.spiritofdevops.com"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/0ea4a894fb1911782b1ed4cafb5f51dcd297452b71e077a91929b41e4461c244?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2027,"template_name":"Low Stock & Sold Out Watcher for Shopify","unique_visitors":620,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":104,"unique_inserters":53,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":13},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2032","wf_detais":{"id":2032,"name":"Poll emails using JMAP ","createdAt":"2023-12-25T11:22:32.536Z","description":"n8n does not currently offer a way to retrieve emails from arbritrary providers via a regular node. Unless you're using Gmail or Outlook, you can only use the email trigger to start a workflow when a new email arrives.\n\nThis currently limits the possible use cases you can cover in your n8n workflows, as you cannot (for example) get an idea of how many unread messages there are in an inbox, or search for specific messages when an event occurs.\n\nBut fear not, there's a new sheriff in town! The [JMAP standard](https://jmap.io/index.html) allows you to interact with your mailboxes, calendars and contacts through single HTTP requests whenever needed.\n\nThis n8n workflow demonstrates how to retrieve the total number of unread messages from a JMAP server and also retrieve details for the first 3 messages. It can easily be adapted to search for messages other than unread, or to return details for more than the first 3 messages.\n\n# Screenshots\n\n![image.png](fileId:722)\n\n![image.png](fileId:721)\n\n# FAQ\n\n## Which n8n version do I need?\n\nThe workflow was built using n8n 1.20 and should work here out of the box. HTTP requests are also supported on older n8n versions, so the workflow can be backported as an alternative.\n\n## Which credentials do I need?\n\nThe JMAP standard does not limit the available authentication options. Fastmail (the sponsor of the standard) supports Bearer authentication as well as OAuth2.\n\nIn n8n you can implement the Fastmail Bearer authentication by creating Header Auth credentials with a name of `Authorization` and a value of `Bearer $apiToken` (replacing `$apiToken` with your actual API token from Fastmail).\n\nFor other services you'd need to check the respective API documentation for more details on the support authentication methods. \n\n## What even is JMAP?\n\nIt's an official Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard, sponsored by Fastmail, that will hopefully replace the legacy standards CalDAV, CardDAV, and IMAP soon. The full specs are [available here](https://jmap.io/spec.html).\n\n## How can I use JMAP?\n\nIf you're a [Fastmail](https://ref.fm/u30544864) customer or if you're hosting your own [Stalwart mail server](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-server) you can use JMAP today.\n\nIf your email provider doesn't yet support JMAP, you might want to contact them and let them know you're interested in this functionality.","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Tom","username":"mutedjam","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["https://github.com/that-one-tom/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/7a3710173e907baffaf7ed7ebffc37955c9cdeadb8612200225a34a2e056aa17?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2032,"template_name":"Poll emails using JMAP ","unique_visitors":109,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":29,"unique_inserters":36,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":4},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2033","wf_detais":{"id":2033,"name":"Real-time lead routing in Webflow","createdAt":"2023-12-28T22:10:10.596Z","description":"This workflow will allow you to enrich in real-time a form submission from Webflow using Datagma. \n\nBased on the result of this workflow, a specific Calendly link will be shown on the website.\n\n- If the process outcome is '1', a link for a one-on-one demo will be provided.\n- If the process outcome is '2', a link for a group demo will be shown.\n\nFull guide here: [Real-time Lead Routing](https://lempire.notion.site/Real-time-lead-routing-9fc55c9a5a17415ba736cbdbf5d43a30?pvs=4)\n","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":10,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Lucas Perret","username":"lucasperret","bio":"","verified":true,"links":[""],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/0b3273e259147247b9921e13c536e06521ebd68ba5198aaff9b141db51eb3d94?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2033,"template_name":"Real-time lead routing in Webflow","unique_visitors":600,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":160,"unique_inserters":64,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":16},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2034","wf_detais":{"id":2034,"name":"Send DingTalk message on new Azure DevOps Pull Request","createdAt":"2023-12-29T02:20:48.068Z","description":"This template automates sending a DingTalk message on new Azure Dev Ops Pull Request Created Events.

Ideal for traders and enthusiasts seeking real-time market insights.\n\n[![659d07c153303c6de24e6442.jpg](fileId:730)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/slG_q_sT_E8)\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Trigger Options**: Choose between a manual trigger or a scheduled trigger to start the workflow.\n2. **Fetch Market Data**: The 'Binance 24h Price Change' node retrieves the latest 24-hour price changes for cryptocurrencies from Binance.\n3. **Identify Significant Changes**: The 'Filter by 10% Change rate' node filters out cryptocurrencies with price changes of 10% or more.\n4. **Aggregate Data**: The 'Aggregate' node combines all significant changes into a single dataset.\n5. **Format Data for Telegram**: The 'Split By 1K chars' node formats this data into chunks suitable for Telegram's message size limit.\n6. **Send Telegram Message**: The 'Send Telegram Message' node broadcasts the formatted message to a specified Telegram chat.\n\n### Set Up Steps\n* **Estimated Time**: About 1-5 minutes for setup.\n* **Initial Configuration**: Set up a Binance API connection (Optional) and your Telegram bot credentials.\n* **Customization**: Adjust the trigger according to your preference (manual or scheduled) and update the Telegram chat ID.\n\n* **Create Telegram bot steps**:-\nSetting up a Telegram bot and obtaining its token involves several steps. Here's a detailed guide:\n\n1. **Start a Chat with BotFather:**\n   - Open Telegram and search for \"BotFather\". This is the official bot that allows you to create new bots.\n   - Start a chat with BotFather by clicking on the \"Start\" button at the bottom of the screen.\n\n2. **Create a New Bot:**\n   - In the chat with BotFather, type `/newbot` and send the message.\n   - BotFather will ask you to choose a name for your bot. This is a display name and can be anything you like.\n   - Next, you'll need to choose a username for your bot. This must be unique and end in `bot`. For example, `my_crypto_alert_bot`.\n\n3. **Receive Your Token:**\n   - After you've set the name and username, BotFather will provide you with a token. This token is like a password for your bot, so keep it secure.\n   - The message will look something like this: \n     ```\n     Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/my_crypto_alert_bot. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands. Use this token to access the HTTP API: 123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11\n     ```\n   - The token in this case is `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`.\n\n4. **Test Your Bot:**\n   - You can find your bot by searching for its username in Telegram.\n   - Start a chat with your bot and try sending it a message. Although it won't respond yet, this step is essential to ensure it's set up correctly.\n\n5. **Use the Token in n8n:**\n   - In your n8n workflow, when setting up the Telegram node, you'll be prompted to enter credentials.\n   - Choose to add new credentials and paste the token you received from BotFather.\n\n6. **Get Your Chat ID:**\n   - To send messages to a specific chat, you need to know the chat ID.\n   - The easiest way to find this is to first message your bot, then use a bot like `@userinfobot` to get your chat ID.\n   - Once you have the chat ID, you can configure it in the Telegram node in your n8n workflow.\n\n7. **Finalize Your Workflow:**\n   - With the bot token and chat ID set up in n8n, your Telegram notifications should work as intended in your workflow.\n\nRemember, keep your bot token secure and never share it publicly. If your token is compromised, you can always generate a new one by chatting with BotFather and selecting `/token`.\n\n### Example result\n\n![siDCAAKSc3.png](fileId:727)\n\n```\nKeywords: n8n workflow, cryptocurrency market, Binance API, Telegram bot, price alert system, automated trading signals, market analysis\n```","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.function":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Nskha","username":"nskha","bio":"Welcome to Nskha!

It's designed to simplify the interaction with Cloudflare's KV storage APIs, enabling users to perform a range of actions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting namespaces and KV pairs.\n\n### Features\n\n* **Efficient Management**: Handle multiple KV operations seamlessly.\n* **User-Friendly**: Easy to use with pre-configured Cloudflare API credentials within n8n.\n* **Customizable**: Flexible for integration into larger workflows (Copy / paste your prefered part).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* n8n workflow automation tool (version 1.19.0 or later).\n* A Cloudflare account with access to KV storage.\n* Pre-configured Cloudflare API credentials in n8n.\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\nThis workflow is divided into three main sections for ease of use:\n\n1. **Single Actions**: Perform individual operations on KV pairs.\n2. **Bulk Actions**: Handle multiple KV pairs simultaneously.\n3. **Specific Actions**: Execute specific tasks like renaming namespaces.\n\n### Key Components\n\n* **Manual Trigger**: Initiates the workflow.\n* **Account Path Node**: Sets the path for account details, a prerequisite for all actions.\n* **HTTP Request Nodes**: Facilitate interaction with Cloudflare's API for various operations.\n* **Sticky Notes**: Provide quick documentation links and brief descriptions of each node's function.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. **Setup Account Path**: Input your Cloudflare account details in the 'Account Path' node. you can get your account path by your cloudflare URL\n![Cloudflare-Screen](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/ARHAEEM/blog/assets/1705073020000m9ecrr.png)\n2. **Choose an Action**: Select the desired operation from the workflow.\n3. **Configure Nodes**: Adjust parameters in the HTTP request nodes as needed. (_each node contain sticky note with direct link to it own document page_)\n4. **Execute Workflow**: Trigger the workflow manually to perform the selected operations.\n## Detailed Node Descriptions\nI covered in this Workflow the full api calls of Cloudflare KV product. \n\n### API NODE: Delete KV\n\n* **Type**: HTTP Request\n* **Function**: Deletes a specified KV pair within a namespace.\n* **Configuration**: This node requires the namespace ID and KV pair name. It automatically fetches these details from preceding nodes, specifically from the \"List KV-NMs\" and \"Set KV-NM Name\" nodes.\n* **Documentation**: [Delete KV Pair API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/workers-kv-namespace-remove-a-namespace)\n\n### API NODE: Create KV-NM\n\n* **Type**: HTTP Request\n* **Function**: Creates a new Key-Value Namespace.\n* **Configuration**: Users need to input the title for the new namespace. This node uses the account information provided by the \"Account Path\" node.\n* **Documentation**: [Create Namespace API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/workers-kv-namespace-create-a-namespace)\n\n### API NODE: Delete KV1\n\n* **Type**: HTTP Request\n* **Function**: Renames an existing Key-Value Namespace.\n* **Configuration**: Requires the old namespace name and the new desired name. It retrieves these details from the \"KV to Rename\" and \"List KV-NMs\" nodes.\n* **Documentation**: [Rename Namespace API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/workers-kv-namespace-rename-a-namespace)\n\n### API NODE: Write KVs inside NM\n\n* **Type**: HTTP Request\n* **Function**: Writes multiple Key-Value pairs inside a specified namespace.\n* **Configuration**: This node needs a JSON array of key-value pairs along with their namespace identifier. It fetches the namespace ID from the \"List KV-NMs\" node.\n* **Documentation**: [Write Multiple KV Pairs API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/workers-kv-namespace-write-multiple-key-value-pairs)\n\n### API NODE: Read Value Of KV In NM\n\n* **Type**: HTTP Request\n* **Function**: Reads the value of a specific Key-Value pair in a namespace.\n* **Configuration**: Requires the Key's name and Namespace ID, which are obtained from the \"Set KV-NM Name\" and \"List KV-NMs\" nodes.\n* **Documentation**: [Read KV Pair API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/workers-kv-namespace-read-key-value-pair)\n\n### API NODE: Read MD from Key\n\n* **Type**: HTTP Request\n* **Function**: Reads the metadata of a specific Key in a namespace.\n* **Configuration**: Similar to the \"Read Value Of KV In NM\" node, it needs the Key's name and Namespace ID, which are obtained from the \"Set KV-NM Name\" and \"List KV-NMs\" nodes.\n* **Documentation**: [Read Metadata API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/workers-kv-namespace-read-the-metadata-for-a-key)\n\n&gt; The rest can be found inside the workflow with sticky/onflow note explain what to do.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n* **Modular Use**: Extract specific parts of the workflow for isolated tasks.\n* **Validation**: Ensure correct namespace and KV pair names before execution.\n* **Security**: Regularly update your Cloudflare API credentials for secure access, and make sure to give your API only access to the KV.\n\n**Keywords**: Cloudflare KV, n8n workflow automation, API integration, key-value storage management.","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":47,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":10},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":16},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":20},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Nskha","username":"nskha","bio":"Welcome to Nskha!

It is ideal for users who need immediate notifications and a secure, temporary web view of their email content.\n\n## Use Cases\n- Immediate notification of new emails in Telegram with the ability to preview the email content in a secure, temporary HTML format.\n- Automation for users who need to keep track of their emails without constantly checking their email client.\n- Useful for teams or individuals who require instant updates on critical emails and prefer a quick preview through a web interface.\n\n## My Personal Use Case: Secure Subscription Sharing\nFrom time to time, I find myself wanting to share my paid subscriptions with friends, but giving out OTP codes manually or sharing my email isn't a good idea due to security concerns. I attempted to use the IMAP node to integrate with Telegram secret channel for this purpose but encountered numerous problems, such as difficulties in scraping content from emails. Additionally, the Telegram API sometimes rejects certain special characters found within email contents. After facing these challenges, I discovered that rendering emails as HTML pages and sharing them directly is the most effective solution. This approach bypasses the issues with character limitations and content scraping, providing a seamless way to share subscription benefits securely.\n\n## Services/APIs Used\n\n| Service/API          | Node Type               | Description                                          |\n|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| IMAP Email Server    | Email Trigger (IMAP)    | Triggers the workflow on receiving a new email.      |\n| Telegram API         | Telegram                | Sends notifications and manages messages in Telegram.|\n| GitHub Gist API      | HTTP Request (Github Gist) | Temporarily hosts email content on GitHub Gist. |\n| GitHub Gist API (Deletion) | HTTP Request (Github Gist ‌) | Deletes the temporary GitHub Gist after a specified time. |\n| Wait                 | Wait                    | Delays the workflow for a specified period.          |\n\n## Configuration Steps\n1. **Email Trigger (IMAP):** Configure your IMAP email credentials to enable the workflow to check for new emails.\n2. **Telegram Nodes:** Insert your Telegram bot's API credentials and your chat ID in both Telegram nodes to send and delete messages.\n3. **Github Gist Nodes:** Provide your GitHub API credentials to create and delete Gists. Ensure the GitHub token has the necessary permissions to create and delete Gists.\n4. **Wait Node:** Adjust the wait time according to your preference for how long the email content should be accessible via the HTML page.\n\n## Screenshot\n![Workflow Screenshot](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/Automations-Project/n8n-templates/main/Email%20Notifications%20to%20Telegram%20using%20Temporary%20HTML%20Hosting%20via%20GitHub%20Gist/preview.png)\n\n## Additional Notes\n- Ensure all credentials are securely stored and have the minimum necessary permissions for the workflow to function.\n- Test the workflow with non-sensitive emails to ensure it operates as expected before using it with critical email accounts.\n- Consider the privacy and security implications of temporarily hosting email content on GitHub Gist.\n\nFor any questions or issues, refer to the respective API documentation for each service used or consult the n8n community for support.","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.emailReadImap":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Nskha","username":"nskha","bio":"Welcome to Nskha!

Often, this required a lot of manual work that includes reviewing each submission, checking if they meet your criteria and then outreaching. With this workflow you can do all of that fully automatically and save a lot of your valuable time.\n# What this workflow does\nThis workflow runs every time you're receiving a new submission from an n8n form. It then filters out typical personal emails (such as Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo etc.) before enriching the submission via Clearbit. It then checks, if the company of the submitter is a B2B company and has more than 499 employees. If it does, it sends an email via Gmail to the user.\n# Setup\n1. Add the `Clearbit` and `Gmail` credentials\n2. Click on `Test Workflow`\n3. Enter your own email (which needs to be a business email to work) in the Form\n4. Check your email\n5. Once you're happy don't forget to activate this workflow\n# How to adjust this template\n- Replace the form trigger with your form provider of choice (e.g. Typeform, SurveyMonkey, Google Forms etc.)\n- Adjust the criteria to your needs via the `If node`\n- Adjust the email you're sending in the `Gmail node`","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":13,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.clearbit":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Niklas Hatje","username":"nik8n","bio":"Product Manager at n8n - Responsible for the creator program","verified":true,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklashatje/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e16a4426e166713c34626bdde856b1cd15bb6787481a7ead9b74318f19e6259d?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2106,"template_name":"Reach out via Email to new form submissions that meet a certain criteria","unique_visitors":571,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":171,"unique_inserters":59,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":15},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2107","wf_detais":{"id":2107,"name":"Enrich Linkedin profile URLs stored in a Google Sheet","createdAt":"2024-02-21T12:05:07.966Z","description":"# Template Information\n\n### Who is this template for?\n  **This template is for users looking to retrieve email information from LinkedIn profiles and update Google Sheets with the collected data.**\n\n- [ 🎥 quick set up video](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF9a_UBxWY/xSSlSUzRdxCPtfgx9RzGSg/watch?utm_content=DAF9a_UBxWY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)\n\n\n- **How it works**\n  - The template utilizes a series of nodes to fetch email information from LinkedIn profiles. It starts with a Schedule Trigger node that sets the interval for the workflow. The Conditional Check node verifies if certain fields like Name, Gender, Job Title, Summary, and LinkedIn URL are not empty. The HTTP Request node sends a POST request to the specified URL with API key and profile information. The Data Merge node merges the data collected. The Field Editing node modifies the fields as needed. Finally, the Google Sheets Update node updates the Google Sheets with the gathered information.\n\n### Set Up Instructions\n\n1. Make sure to have the necessary credentials and permissions for accessing LinkedIn and Google Sheets.\n2. Set up the API key required for the HTTP Request node.\n3. Configure the Google Sheets Update node with the appropriate document ID and sheet name.\n4. Check and adjust field mappings in the Field Editing node according to your needs.\n5. Run the workflow and monitor the updates in your Google Sheets document.\n\n## Overview:\n\n\nThe workflow is designed to find contact information for LinkedIn profile URLs stored in a Google Sheet. It involves various nodes for different operations such as making HTTP requests, scheduling triggers, reading from and updating Google Sheets, field editing, data merging, and conditional checks. A video demonstrating the workflow process can be accessed [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF9a_UBxWY/xSSlSUzRdxCPtfgx9RzGSg/watch?success=true&continue_in_browser=true).\n\n## Copy this template to get started :\n- [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ochnGSCy8V5Mz-nr51dBmugqR50m62K7d6pvbwOHewo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n## Using Prospeo.io LinkedIn Email Finder API with cURL\n\nTo use the API endpoint \"https://api.prospeo.io/linkedin-email-finder\" with cURL, follow these steps:\n\n1. Use the cURL command with the following parameters:\n   \n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-KEY: your_api_key\" \\\n-d '{\n  \"url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-doe/\"\n}' \\\n\"https://api.prospeo.io/linkedin-email-finder\"\n```\n\n2. Replace \"your_api_key\" with your actual API key.\n3. Update the \"url\" field in the JSON data with the LinkedIn profile URL for which you want to find the email address.\n\nTo get access to this API and obtain your API key, you need to sign up on the Prospeo platform and subscribe to their LinkedIn email finder service. Once you have subscribed, you will receive an API key that you can use to authenticate your requests to the API endpoint.\n## Description:\n\n- **Schedule Trigger:**\n  - Triggers the workflow based on a defined schedule interval, in this case, based on minutes.\n  - [Schedule Trigger Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger)\n\n- **Google Sheets Read:**\n  - Reads data from a Google Sheets document and sheet based on the provided document ID and sheet name.\n  - [Google Sheets Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets) \n  \n- **Conditional Check:**\n  - Checks multiple conditions based on the input data and performs actions accordingly.\n  - [Conditional Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if)\n\n- **HTTP Request:**\n  - Sends an HTTP POST request to a specified URL with headers and body parameters.\n  - [HTTP Request Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest)\n\n\n- **No Operation, do nothing:**\n  - Placeholder node that does not perform any operation.\n\n- **Data Merge:**\n  - Merges data based on specified mode and combination settings.\n  - [Merge Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge)\n\n- **Field Editing:**\n  - Edits fields by setting specific values for each field based on input data.\n  - [Set Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set)\n\n- **Google Sheets Update:**\n  - Updates data in a Google Sheets document and sheet based on specified columns and values.\n  - [Google Sheets Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets)\n","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":11,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"AlQaisi","username":"omar","bio":"I'm specialize in automation and AI, developing innovative solutions to enhance efficiency and drive innovation.

Once it finds one, it enriches the deal with information about the assigned contact and their company. It then checks the region of the assigned company before looking at the company's employee size. Based on this, it assigns the deal to the right sales rep within your company.\n# Requirements\n- New deals in Hubspot need to be unassigned in the beginning\n- New deals have to have an attached contact that has an attached company in Hubspot\n- The company needs to have values for region and employee count in Hubspot\n# Setup\nThe setup is quite straight forward and will probably take a few minutes only.\n1. Add your **Hubspot** credentials\n2. Customize your criterias for assigning deals in the `Assign by Region` and the following `Assign` nodes\n3.

The workflow can be triggered manually via the \"Execute Workflow\" button or scheduled to run at a specific time using the \"Schedule Trigger\" node.\n\n2. The sitemap of your website is fetched using the \"sitemap_set\" node with a HTTP Request to the sitemap URL. \n\n3. This XML sitemap is then converted into a JSON file using the \"sitemap_convert\" node.\n\n4. The \"sitemap_parse\" node splits the JSON file into individual URLs.\n\n5. The \"url_set\" node then prepares each URL to be sent to the Google Indexing API.\n\n6. A loop is created using the \"loop\" node to process each URL individually and make a POST request to Google Indexing API indicating that the URL has been updated.\n\n7. If the POST request is successful and the URL has been updated, the workflow waits for 2 seconds before moving to the next URL.\n\n8. In case the daily limit for the Google Indexing API is reached (200/day by default), an error message is triggered using the \"Stop and Error\" node.\n# Before you use the workflow\n## Activate the indexing API\n* Create an account with Google Cloud Platform &gt; Console and then create a new project\n* Search for the Indexing API in the Library\n* Activate the API\n\n## Create a Service Account and get credentials\n* Open the Service accounts page. If prompted, select a project.\n* Click add Create Service Account, enter a name and description for the service account. You can use the default service account ID, or choose a different, unique one. \n* When done click Create.\n* On the Grant users access to this service account screen, scroll down to the Create key section. Click add Create key.\n* In the side panel that appears, select the JSON format\n* Click Create. Your new public/private key pair is generated and downloaded to your machine.\n* Open the file and copy the private key.\n* Add the credentials in the url_index node\n\n![image.png](fileId:743)\n\n\n## Add the user as owner of the site\nBeware, for each site you need to add the user as a owner like this:\n\n![image.png](fileId:742)\n\n## Set your sitemap\n\n* Open the sitemap_set node and add the url to your sitemap.\n\n-------\n*Now you should be able to ensure that Google is always up-to-date with the latest content on your website, improving your website's visibility and SEO rankings, have fun!*","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":12,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.xml":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stopAndError":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Joachim Brindeau","username":"joachimbrindeau","bio":"","verified":false,"links":["https://intellectual-property.org"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/174b62612bac1c4785b1fae6e60956cdd087547f050c6fdd183b9a14c39e31a2?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2123,"template_name":"Simple Google indexing Workflow in N8N","unique_visitors":1695,"unique_weekly_visitors":1,"unique_monthly_visitors":156,"unique_inserters":207,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":26},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2124","wf_detais":{"id":2124,"name":"List social media activity of a company before a call","createdAt":"2024-02-23T08:13:28.377Z","description":"# How it works\nIt’s very important to come prepared to Sales calls.

UTM parameters are particularly essential as they provide granular details about the source, medium, and campaign effectiveness. \nHowever, when this data is not automatically integrated into a centralized system, it can become a tedious and error-prone process to manually collate and analyze it.\n\nRetrieving UTM data from Shopify and storing it in Baserow enables oy to do more with this data. For example you could build a campaign database in Baserow and automatically add campaign revenue to it using this workflow template.\n\n![20240223_11h48m44s_grim.png](fileId:744)\n\n## This template will help you:\n\n1.

You also need to set up the custom fields `Domain` and `Enriched at` in Pipedrive.\n## Setup\n1. Go to Company Settings -&gt; Data fields -&gt; Organization and add `Domain` as a custom field\n2.

The first email is sent to everyone, but the later emails in the sequence are only sent if no-one has replied to the thread yet.\n\nThis means you only need to worry about replying to people who respond to your email, not chasing people who don’t.\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. A list of emails in a Google sheet. You can define extra info that will be available to your email templates (e.g. name, company, etc.)\n\n![table.png](fileId:750)\n\n2. A sequence of emails to send, plus how long to wait to send each one, e.g.\n\n- **On day 0:** “Hi, {name} — nice to meet you at the conference. Was wondering whether {company} would be interested in a quick call about X?”\n- **On day 3:** “Hi, {name}, just wanted to check in on this. Let me know if there’s any interest!”\n- **On day 7:** “{name}, just wanted to give this one last try”\n\n3. A Gmail account (although you could also swap out that part for any other email service)\n\n### How it works\n\nWhen sending the emails, n8n inserts a hidden attribute in each one that tags it as being part of the email campaign.

It’s time to send the next message\n\nThe workflow doesn’t send emails on weekends.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This workflow is not intended for spam!

Since we're using our product at n8n a lot, we wanted to make it as easy as possible for everyone to add bugs with the needed level of detail. That's why we built this workflow that allows everyone to add bugs to our Linear account easily directly from Slack\n## What this workflow does\nThis workflow waits for a webhook call within Slack, that gets fired when users use the `/bug` command on a bot that you will create as part of this template. It then adds the bug to Linear using a pre-defined description and a defined label. It then notifies the user about the newly added bug as you can see below:\n\n![image 17.png](fileId:762)\n\n## How to create your Slack bot\n1. Visit https://api.slack.com/apps, click on New App and choose a name and workspace.\n2. Click on OAuth & Permissions and scroll down to Scopes -&gt; Bot token Scopes\n3. Add the `chat:write` scope\n4. Head over to `Slash Commands` and click on `Create New Command`\n5. Use `/bug` as the command\n6. Copy the test URL from the **Webhook** node into `Request URL`\n7. Add whatever feels best to the description and usage hint\n8. Go to `Install app` and click install\n\n## Setup\n1. Configure your Slack bot using the sticky to the left\n2. Fill the `Set me up` node. You can find the IDs easily using the Helper nodes section\n3. Make sure to exchange the `Request URL` in your Slack with the Prod URL of the Webhook node before activating this workflow  \n\n## How to adjust it to your needs\n- Add zero, one, two or many labels when creating the new ticket\n- Change the Slack message according to your needs\n- Change the default description for a new bug ticket\n- Rename the Slack command as it works best for you\n\n## How to enhance this workflow\nAt n8n we use this workflow in combination with some others. E.g. we have the following things on top:\n- We're using AI to classify the bugs and move them to the right team as soon as they get added to Linear (see [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2154-classify-new-bugs-in-linear-with-openais-gpt-4-and-move-them-to-the-right-team))\n- We also added other commands like `/pain` and `/idea` that allow us to submit other things to Notion.

Normally this includes a manual grooming of new bugs that have arrived in your ticketing system (in our case Linear). We found this way too time-consuming. That's why we built this workflow.\n\n## What this workflow does\nThis workflow triggers every time a Linear issue is created or updated within a certain team. For us at n8n, we created one general team called Engineering where all bugs get added in the beginning. The workflow then checks if the issue meets the criteria to be auto-moved to a certain team. In our case, that means that the description is filled, that it has the bug label, and that it's in the `Triage` state. The workflow then classifies the bug using OpenAI's GPT-4 model before updating the team property of the Linear issue. If the AI fails to classify a team, the workflow sends an alert to Slack.\n\n## Setup\n1. Add your Linear and OpenAi credentials\n2. Change the team in the `Linear Trigger` to match your needs\n3. Customize your teams and their areas of responsibility in the `Set me up` node. Please use the format `[Teamname][Description/Areas of responsibility]`. Also, make sure that the team names match the names in Linear exactly.\n4. Change the Slack channel in the `Set me up` node to your Slack channel of choice.\n\n## How to adjust it to your needs\n- Play around with the context that you're giving to OpenAI, to make sure the model has enough knowledge about your teams and their areas of responsibility\n- Adjust the handling of AI failures to your needs\n\n## How to enhance this workflow\nAt n8n we use this workflow in combination with some others.

At n8n, we have been using them to get a lot done.. But it can become hard to manage and maintain many different operations that a workflow can do.\n\nThis is the base workflow we use for our most powerful internal Slackbots. They handle a lot from running e2e tests for Github branch to deleting a user. By splitting the workflow into many subworkflows, we are able to handle each command seperately, making it easier to debug as well as support new usecases.\n\nIn this template, you can find eveything to setup your own Slackbot (and I made it simple, there's only one node to configure 😉). After that, you need to build your commands directly. \n\nThis bot can create a new thread on an alerts channel and respond there.\n![Screenshot 20240301 at 07.54.07.png](fileId:769)\n![Screenshot 20240301 at 08.03.33.png](fileId:767)\n\nOr reply directly to the user.\n![Screenshot 20240301 at 07.53.41.png](fileId:766)\n\nIt responds for help request to return a help page.\n![Screenshot 20240301 at 08.16.40.png](fileId:764)\n\nIt automatically handles unknown commands.\n![Screenshot 20240301 at 08.16.54.png](fileId:765)\n\nIt also supports flags and environment variables.

Add Slack command and point it up to the webhook. For example.\n![Screenshot 20240229 at 22.09.40.png](fileId:771)\n2. Add the following to the **Set config** node\n- `alerts_channel` with alerts channel to start threads on\n- `instance_url` with this instance url to make it easy to debug\n- `slack_token` with slack bot token to validate request\n- `slack_secret_signature` with slack secret signature to validate request\n- `help_docs_url` with help url to help users understand the commands \n3.

It's particularly useful for teams looking to streamline their documentation efforts and ensure consistency across their workflow documentation.\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case\n\nThe primary problem this workflow addresses is the manual and time-consuming process of creating documentation for n8n workflows. It automates the generation of concise, clear, and comprehensive documentation directly from the workflow's JSON, making it easier for both technical and non-technical users to understand what the workflow does and how it operates.\n\n## What this workflow does\n\nUpon receiving a form submission with the workflow title and JSON, this workflow automatically generates documentation that includes:\n- A brief introduction to the workflow.\n- The trigger mechanism (webhook URLs for test and production environments, or cron schedules).\n- Setup requirements, including necessary credentials and external dependencies.\n\n\n## Setup\n\n1. **Credentials Setup**: Ensure you have OpenAI API credentials configured in n8n to use the GPT model for generating documentation text.\n2. **Form Submission**: Users must submit the form with the workflow title and JSON. The form is accessible via:\n   - Test URL: `domain/form-test/{webhookId}`\n   - Production URL: `domain/form/{webhookId}`\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- **Modify Trigger URLs**: Adjust the webhook or form URLs based on your domain and specific n8n setup.\n- **Customize Documentation Template**: Edit the OpenAI node's prompt to change the structure or details of the generated documentation.\n- **Extend Functionality**: Add nodes to integrate with other systems (e.g., automatically publishing the documentation to a wiki or sending it via email).\n\nThis workflow simplifies the documentation process, making it accessible and manageable for teams of all sizes and technical abilities.

The workflow uses technologies provided by Open AI: Chat GPT for the text and Dall-E for the image.\n\nI suggest reviewing the created posts before publishing them on your WordPress website.\n\nThe article generation might take some minutes as each chapter is created independently.\n\n### Features\n\n- **Easy to use:** Easy web interface to start the generation of the WordPress post\n- **AI-powered:** Text and image generation is done by artificial intelligence\n- **Long-text ready:** Possibility to create very long articles\n- **Configurable:** Possibility to provide as many keywords as you want, to choose the number of chapters and the length of the article\n- **Plugs into your WordPress:** Easily integrates with your WordPress website\n- **Tweak it as you want:** Fine-tune the Open AI prompts and the workflow as you want\n\n### Workflow Steps\n\n- **User form:** An n8n form is used to trigger the post creation\n- **Settings:** This node is used to set your WordPress URL (which is used later in the workflow)\n- **Article structure:** First AI action that writes the introduction, the conclusions, and the chapter structure.\n- **Data check:** Check that the data provided by the AI is valid\n- **Chapters split/Chapters text:** Splits the data for each chapter in a separate item and generates each chapter's text with AI\n- **Content preparation:** Prepares the text for posting merging the introduction, the chapters, and the conclusions. Adds some basic HTML formatting\n- **Draft on WordPress:** Creates the draft post on WordPress\n- **Featured image:** Creates a featured image and adds it to the post on WordPress\n- **User feedback:** Sends a feedback to the user on the n8n form\n\n### Getting Started\n\nTo deploy and use this template:\n\n1. Import the workflow into your n8n workspace\n2. Set your WordPress URL in the `wordpress_url` field in the \"Settings\" node. Include the slash (`/`) at the end of the URL\n3. Set up your Open AI n8n credentials by following [this guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/). The Open AI credentials are used by the Open AI nodes (\"Create post title and structure\", \"Create chapters text\", and \"Generate featured image\")\n4. Set up your WordPress n8n credentials by following [this guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/wordpress/). The WordPress credentials are used by the WordPress and HTTP Request nodes (\"Post on Wordpress\", \"Upload media\", and \"Set image ID for the post\"). Pay attention that the \"Password\" in the WordPress credentials is not the user's password by the Application Password\n\n### How use the workflow to create a WordPress post\n\n1. Activate the workflow\n2. Open the \"Form\" node and copy the \"Production URL\". This is the public URL of the form to AI-write the post\n3. Open the URL in a browser and fill in the form\n4. Wait a few minutes till you get the feedback in the form that the post was created\n5. Go to WordPress and check the newly created draft post. Review and publish your post!\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":37,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wordpress":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":22},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolWikipedia":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Giulio","username":"gandreini","bio":"Product designer at n8n, founder of Mondo surf atlas and forecast","verified":false,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/giulioandreini/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8881c112afdb9ed815d053eef68dd3d35629caec4ec9ab505eb57e7279791230?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2187,"template_name":"Write a WordPress post with AI (starting from a few keywords)","unique_visitors":12160,"unique_weekly_visitors":4,"unique_monthly_visitors":2262,"unique_inserters":3285,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":380},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2189","wf_detais":{"id":2189,"name":"Assistant for Hubspot Chat using OpenAi and Airtable","createdAt":"2024-03-23T18:31:45.702Z","description":"This workflow will allow you to use OpenAI Assistant API together with a chatting platform.

Tired of manually clicking through each page in the Google Search Console? 😴 Say goodbye to that tedious process and hello to automation with this n8n workflow! 🎉\n\n**NB: this workflow was tested with sitemap.xml generated by Ghost CMS and WordPress.\nReach out to [Eduard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parsadanyan/) if you need help adapting this workflow to your specific use-case!**\n\n## ⚙️ How this automation works\n\n1. 📅 The workflow runs on a schedule or when you click \"Test workflow\".\n2. 🌐 It fetches the website's primary sitemap.xml and extracts all the content-specific sitemaps (this is a typical structure of the sitemap).\n3. 📑 Each content-specific sitemap is then parsed to retrieve the individual page data.\n4. 🔄 The extracted page data is converted to JSON format for easy manipulation.\n5. 🗃️ The `lastmod` (last modified date) and `loc` (page URL) fields are assigned to each page entry to ensure compliance with the [Sitemap protocol](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html).\n6. 🔀 The page entries are sorted by the `lastmod` field in descending order (newest to oldest).\n7. 🔁 The workflow then loops over each page entry and performs the following steps:\n   - 🔍 Checks the URL metadata in the Google Indexing API.\n   - ✅ If the page is new or has been updated since the last indexing request, it sends a request to the Google Indexing API to update the URL.\n   - ⏳ Wait a sec and move on with the next page.\n\n## 🌟 Benefits\n\n- ⏰ Save time by automating the indexing process.\n- 🎯 Ensure all your website pages are consistently indexed by Google.\n- 🚀 Improve your website's visibility and search engine rankings.\n- 🛠️ Customize the workflow to fit your specific CMS and requirements.\n\n## 🔧 Getting started\n\nTo start using this powerful n8n workflow, follow these steps:\n\n1. ☑️ Make sure to verify the website ownership in the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).\n2. 👨‍💻 Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance.\n3. **Edit the `Get sitemap.xml` node and update the URL with your website's valid sitemap.xml**\n4. 🔑 Set up the necessary credentials for the Google Indexing API.\n5. 🎚️ Adjust the schedule trigger to run the workflow at your desired frequency.\n7. 🎉 Sit back and let the workflow handle the indexing process for you!\n\nReady to take your website indexing to the next level? 🚀 Try this workflow now and see the difference it makes! 😊\n\n### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE 1\nNeed help with connecting Google Cloud Platform to n8n? Check out our [article on connecting Google Sheets to n8n](https://blog.n8n.io/google-sheets-as-database/#step-1-obtain-google-service-account-credentials). The process is mainly the same. When activating Google APIs, make sure to add `Web Search Indexing API`. Also, in the credential page of n8n, add the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/indexing` scope:\n\n![image.png](fileId:781)\n\nCheck out [Yulia's page](https://n8n.io/creators/yulia/) for more n8n workflows!\n\n### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE 2\nFree Google Cloud Platform account allows (re)indexing only 200 pages per day. If your website has more, then the workflow will automatically fail on quota limit ⛔. Next day it will skip the previously added items and continue with remaining pages. \n\n***Example:*** Assuming you have a free Google account, 500 pages on your website and they don't change for 3 days:\n* On the first day 200 pages will be added for indexing and the workflow will fail due to quota limits.\n* On the second day, the workflow will check 200 pages again and skip them (because the date of re-indexing is later then the page last modified date). The next 200 pages will be added to indexing. Workflow will fail again due to quota limits.\n* On the third day 400 pages will be checked and skipped, the last 100 pages will be added for indexing and the workflow finishes successfully.","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":21,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.xml":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.sort":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Eduard","username":"eduard","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/parsadanyan/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a551e67c6fe7affd5f882a527dee154bb6c3ac90cf878326accb3fb3ec77c8a6?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2210,"template_name":"Get your website indexed by Google automatically","unique_visitors":2636,"unique_weekly_visitors":2,"unique_monthly_visitors":411,"unique_inserters":622,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":72},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2211","wf_detais":{"id":2211,"name":"Batch update all your Youtube video descriptions in one click","createdAt":"2024-04-01T17:00:13.935Z","description":"Keeping your YouTube video descriptions updated and consistent across your channel can be a daunting task.

This innovative project leverages automation through n8n to streamline tasks and enhance user experience.\n\n## Project Benefit 🎧🌟\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to transform \"CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS\" emails into engaging audio content. By converting text into speech, users can enjoy promotional material hands-free, making it easier to consume information while on the go or relaxing. The workflow consists of several key steps orchestrated seamlessly to deliver a delightful experience to users.\n\n### How to Use the Workflow:\n\n1. **Gmail trigger Node**: Initiates the workflow by fetching \"CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS\" emails at regular intervals.\n\n     The Gmail Trigger node in your N8N workflow is set to poll for new emails every minute and is configured to filter emails with the label \"CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS\" before triggering the workflow.\n\n   #### Steps to Use Filters Inside the Gmail Trigger Node:\n\n\n\n   Configure Gmail Trigger Node:\n\n   Set \"Poll Times\" to \"Every Minute\" to check for new emails at regular intervals.\nEnable the \"Simple\" toggle if you want to simplify the node interface.\nUnder \"Filters\", specify the label IDs you want to filter by. In this case, it's set to \"CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS\".\nAdjust any additional options as needed.\n\n\n    // Configure Gmail Trigger node pollTimes: { item: [ { mode: \"everyMinute\" } ] }, simple: false, filters: { labelIds: [ \"CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS\" ] }, options: {}\n\n\n\n      **Save and Execute**:\n   - Save your workflow and execute it to start monitoring your Gmail account for new emails with the specified label filter.\n\n     By following these steps, your workflow will effectively trigger based on new emails that match the \"CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS\" label in your Gmail account.\n\n2. **Get message content Node**: Extracts the email content for processing.\n      \n3. **Summarization Chain Node**: Generates concise summaries using advanced methods for better readability.\n   \n4. **Delete the unnecessary items Node**: Removes irrelevant details from the email content.\n   \n5. **Text to Free TTS Node**: Converts the summary text into speech using Free TTS technology.\n   \n6. **Convert from base64 to File Node**: Transforms the audio data into a compatible file format.\n   \n7. **Merge Text with Audio Node**: Combines the text and audio components seamlessly.\n   \n8. **Aggregate in same cell Node**: Gathers all processed data for finalization.\n   \n9. **Send Message to Telegram Node**: Dispatches the audio message along with a caption to a designated Telegram chat ID.\n\nBy automating these tasks, the workflow ensures efficient communication and delivers content in a more engaging format, fostering a positive user experience.\n\n### Configuration Instructions:\n\nThe configuration of this workflow involves setting up the necessary nodes and establishing connections between them. Each node performs a specific function crucial to the overall operation of the workflow. Additionally, credentials need to be provided for accessing Gmail and OpenAI services to enable seamless data processing and summarization.\n\n## Utilizing Text-to-Speech API 🎧\n\nIn addition to n8n automation, an external Text-to-Speech API plays a pivotal role in generating audio content from text data. By sending a POST request with JSON data containing the text and voice preferences, users can quickly receive audio files of the converted content. The API offers a straightforward interface for text-to-speech conversion, making it ideal for creating audio clips efficiently.\n\nTo access this API, simply submit the desired text and voice selection to receive the generated speech audio file. The API endpoint can be accessed at [https://tiktok-tts.weilnet.workers.dev/api/generation](https://tiktok-tts.weilnet.workers.dev/api/generation) or through [https://tiktokvoicegenerator.com/](https://tiktokvoicegenerator.com/).\n\nIn conclusion, this n8n workflow coupled with a Text-to-Speech API presents a powerful solution for transforming emails into captivating podcasts, enhancing user engagement and communication effectiveness. By embracing automation and innovative technologies, this project aims to improve user experience and streamline content delivery processes. 🌈✨🚀","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":14,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmailTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.convertToFile":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainSummarization":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"AlQaisi","username":"omar","bio":"I'm specialize in automation and AI, developing innovative solutions to enhance efficiency and drive innovation.

Unfortunately, not every software still supports XML, as many switched to more modern storing languages such as JSON. This workflow is designed to handle the conversion of XML data to JSON format via a webhook call, with error handling and Slack notifications integrated into the process. \n\n## How this workflow works\n1. **Triggering the workflow:**\n    - This workflow initiates upon receiving an HTTP POST request at the webhook endpoint specified in the \"POST\" node. The endpoint, designated as <WEBHOOK_URL>, can be accessed externally by sending a POST request to that URL.\n2. **Data routing and processing:**\n    - Upon receiving the POST request, the Switch node routes the workflow's path based on conditions determined by the content type of the incoming data or any encountered errors.\n    - The Extract From File and Edit Fields (Set) nodes manage XML input processing, adapting their actions according to the data's content type.\n3. **XML to JSON conversion**:\n    - The XML data extracted from the input is passed through the \"XML\" node, which performs the conversion process, transforming it into JSON format.\n4. **Response handling:**\n- If the XML-to-JSON conversion is successful, a success response is sent back with a status of \"OK\" and the converted JSON data.\n- If there are any errors during the XML-to-JSON conversion process, an error response is sent back with a status of \"error\" and an error message.\n- Error handling: in case of an error during processing, the workflow sends a notification to a Slack channel designated for error reporting.\n\n## **Set up steps**\n1. Set up your own <WEBHOOK_URL> in the Webhook node. While building or testing a workflow, use a test webhook URL. When your workflow is ready, switch to using the production webhook URL. \n2.

It can be particularly useful for:\n\n- The accounting department: for generating invoices in PDF format, thus streamlining the invoicing process and payment tracking.\n- The human resources department: for creating employment contracts in PDF, simplifying the administrative management of employees.\n- IT project management teams: for producing Word documents, such as project specifications, to clearly define project requirements and objectives.\n\n#### Example result in mail\n\n![invoice.png](fileId:794)\n\nThis PDF and Word document generation workflow offers a practical and efficient solution for automating administrative and document-related tasks, allowing teams to focus on higher-value activities.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow currently operates with an n8n form, but you can easily replace this form with a webhook triggered by an external application such as AirTable, SharePoint, DocuWare, etc.\n\nOnce the configuration information is retrieved, we fill the API request body of JSReport. The body is defined at the time of template creation in JSReport ([Example of JSReport usage](https://youtu.be/nz1SKdOKAhM?si=aMWGMgMuYCnky28z)).\n\nThen, in a straightforward manner, we fetch the PDF and send it via email.\n\nHere's a brief overview of this n8n workflow template: [Link to n8n workflow template presentation](https://youtu.be/jjjXCj3flPI?si=C73gd51ZeQ_l-1Bh)\n\n\n## To summarize\n\n1. This workflow integrates with an n8n form, but it's flexible to work with various triggering methods like webhooks from other applications such as AirTable, SharePoint, or DocuWare.\n2. After configuring the necessary information, it populates the API request body of JSReport, which defines the template in JSReport.\n3. Once the template is populated, it retrieves the PDF and sends it via email.\n4. In essence, it streamlines the process of generating PDF documents based on user input and distributing them via email.\n\n## Instructions:\n\n1. Create a JSReport Account: Sign up for a JSReport account to create your PDF template model.\n2. Define PDF Template in JSReport: Use JSON data from your system to set up the content of your PDF template in JSReport.\n3. Configure HTTP Request in n8n: Use the HTTP Request node in n8n to send a request to JSReport. Set the node's body to the JSON data defining your PDF template.\nWatch the Video: [For detailed setup guidance, watch the setup video](https://youtu.be/fRoRze7CBY4).\n\nRemember, this template was created in n8n v1.38.2.\n","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":5,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"NonoCode","username":"nonocode","bio":"I am an expert in business process automation, specializing in the use of Nintex and n8n.

It is particularly useful for:\n\n- **HR Departments**: Automating the collection and response to training feedback.\n- **Training Managers**: Streamlining the process of handling feedback and ensuring timely follow-up.\n- **Corporate Trainers**: Receiving direct feedback and taking actions to improve training sessions.\n\n![image.png](fileId:802)\n\nThis workflow offers a comprehensive solution for automating feedback management, ensuring timely responses, and improving the quality of training programs.\n\n---\n\n### How it works\n\nThis workflow operates with an Airtable trigger but can be easily adapted to work with other triggers like webhooks from external applications.\n\nOnce feedback data is captured, the workflow evaluates the feedback and directs it to the appropriate channel for action. Tasks are created in Usertask based on the feedback rating, and notifications are sent to relevant parties.\n\nHere’s a brief overview of this n8n workflow template:\n\n- **Airtable Trigger**: Captures new or updated feedback entries from Airtable.\n- **Switch Node**: Evaluates the feedback rating and directs the workflow based on the rating.\n- **Webhook**: Retrieves the result of a Usertask task.\n- **Task Creation**:\n  - Creates tasks in Usertask for poor feedback.\n  - Creates follow-up tasks for fair to good feedback.\n  - Documents positive feedback and posts recognition on LinkedIn for very good to excellent ratings.\n- **Notifications**:\n  - Sends email notifications to responsible parties for urgent actions.\n  - Sends congratulatory emails and posts on LinkedIn for positive feedback.\n\n---\n\n### To summarize\n\n- **Flexible Integration**: This workflow can be triggered by various methods like Airtable updates or webhooks from other applications.\n- **Automated Task Management**: It creates tasks in Usertask based on feedback ratings to ensure timely follow-up.\n- **Multichannel Notifications**: Sends notifications via email and LinkedIn to keep stakeholders informed and recognize successes.\n- **Comprehensive Feedback Handling**: Automates the evaluation and response to training feedback, improving efficiency and response time.\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Set Up Airtable**: Create a table in Airtable to capture training feedback.\n2. **Configure n8n**: Set up the Airtable trigger in n8n to capture new or updated feedback entries.\n3. **Set Up Usertask**: Configure the Usertask nodes in n8n to create and manage tasks based on feedback ratings.\n4. **Configure Email and LinkedIn Nodes**: Set up the email and LinkedIn nodes to send notifications and post updates.\n5. **Test the Workflow**: Run tests to ensure the workflow captures feedback, creates tasks, and sends notifications correctly.\n\n---\n\nVideo : [https://youtu.be/U14MhTcpqeY](https://youtu.be/U14MhTcpqeY)\n\n\nRemember, this template was created in n8n v1.38.2.","categories":[{"id":17,"name":"HR"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":16,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.linkedIn":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.emailSend":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.airtableTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"NonoCode","username":"nonocode","bio":"I am an expert in business process automation, specializing in the use of Nintex and n8n.

Even worse, the “Last edited time” property, we could use for polling, only updates every minute. This gives us a polling interval only as low as 2 minutes and we still need to implement a comparing mechanism to detect changes.\n\n## Solution\n\nThis workflow caches states in between while doing efficient polling & comparing.

Thank you for the groundwork, Matheus.\n\n## How it works:\n1. Store your snippets of text in a Notion table.  Each snippet should have an image associated with it (copy + pasted into the text)\n2. Connect to your table via a Notion _\"integration\"_, from which N8N can then query your pre-meditated posts\n3. The text is fed through an OpenAI assistant to boost engagement via formatting\n4. The re-formatted text along with the image pulled from the Notion snippet are combined into a post for your LinkedIn\n5. The row in the original Notion table from step 1 containing this post is set to a status of _\"Done\"_\n\n## Set up steps:\n- You will need to create a Notion _\"integration\"_, which will yield a _\"secret key\"_ which you enter into your N8N as a _\"Credential\"_. \n- You will need to create a LinkedIn _\"app\"_ in order to post on your behalf.  When creating your LinkedIn _\"app\"_, you will be required to link this _\"app\"_ to a company page on LinkedIn.  If you are doing this for yourself, seach for the _\"Default Company Payge (for API testing)\"_, and select this page as it is provided by LinkedIn for individuals.  You can find your LinkedIn apps here, and if you get stuck, further instructions on setting up this workflow (including this LinkedIn OAuth piece) can be found in this [YouTube Video Aide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOgmv6E9PAM) to these instructions.\n- Lastly, you will need to create an OpenAI API key, found on your [OpenAI Playground Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat).  Once you created an API key, make sure you have an assistant created from the _\"Assistants\"_ tab on the OpenAI dashboard.

Using the \"URLs tool\", the agent is able to retrieve all links from the page and navigate to them. \n\nFor example, if you want to retrieve contact information, agent will try to find a subpage that might contain this information (e.g. example.com/contact) and extract the information using the text tool.  \n\n## Set up steps\n\n1. Connect database with input data (website addresses) or pin sample data to trigger node. \n2. Configure the crawling agent to retrieve the desired data (e.g. modify prompt and/or parsing schema).\n3.

It assumes there is a custom \"website\" field in your Pipedrive setup, as data will be scraped from this website to generate a note using OpenAI. Then, a notification is sent in Slack.\n\n## ⚠️ Disclaimer\n**This workflow uses a scraping API. Before using it, ensure you comply with the regulations regarding web scraping in your country or state**.\n\n## Important Notes\n- The **OpenAI model used is GPT-4o**, chosen for its large input token capacity. However, it is not the cheapest model if cost is very important to you.\n\n- The system prompt in the OpenAI Node generates output with relevant information, but feel free to improve or **modify it according to your needs**.\n\n## **How It Works**\n\n### Node 1: `Pipedrive Trigger - An Organization is Created`\nThis is the trigger of the workflow. When **an organization object is created in Pipedrive**, this node is triggered and retrieves the data. **Make sure you have a \"website\" custom field in Pipedrive** (the name of the field in the n8n node will appear as a random ID and not with the Pipedrive custom field name).\n\n### Node 2: `ScrapingBee - Get Organization's Website's Homepage Content`\nThis node **scrapes the content** from the URL of the website associated with the **Pipedrive Organization** created in Node 1. The workflow uses the [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/) API, but **you can use any preferred API or simply the HTTP request node in n8n**.\n\n### Node 3: `OpenAI - Message GPT-4o with Scraped Data`\nThis node sends HTML-scraped data from the previous node to the **OpenAI GPT-4o model**. The system prompt instructs the model to **extract company data**, such as products or services offered and competitors (if known by the model), and format it as HTML for optimal use in a Pipedrive Note.\n\n### Node 4: `Pipedrive - Create a Note with OpenAI Output`\nThis node **adds a Note to the Organization created in Pipedrive** using the OpenAI node output. The Note will include the company description, target market, selling products, and competitors (if GPT-4o was able to determine them).\n\n### Node 5 & 6: `HTML To Markdown` & `Code - Markdown to Slack Markdown`\nThese two nodes **format the HTML output to Slack Markdown**.\n\nThe Note created in Pipedrive is in HTML format, **as specified by the System Prompt of the OpenAI Node**. To send it to Slack, it needs to be converted to Markdown and then to Slack Markdown.\n\n### Node 7: `Slack - Notify`\nThis node **sends a message in Slack containing the Pipedrive Organization Note** created with this workflow.\n","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.markdown":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.pipedrive":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.pipedriveTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Dataki","username":"dataki","bio":"I am passionate about transforming complex processes into seamless automations with n8n.

Developers can utilize it as an alternative to n8n's built-in OAuth flow to achieve improved control and visibility. In this template, I've used [Pipedrive API](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/Oauth#get-tokens), but users can apply it with any app that requires the authorization_code for token access.\n\nThis resolves the issue of manually refreshing the OAuth 2.0 token when it expires, or when n8n's native OAuth stops working.\n\n## What you need to replicate this\n\n1. Your database with a pre-existing table for storing authentication tokens and associated information. I'm using Supabase in this example, but you can also employ a self-hosted MySQL.\n\nHere's a [quick video](https://go.screenpal.com/watch/cZiXhEV8N0y) on setting up the Supabase table.\n\n\n2.

Please watch the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/6nXi_yverss) for a detailed demonstration of the workflow:\n\n\n## How it operates\n\n**Workflow 1**. Create a workflow to capture the authorization_code, generate the access_token, and refresh the token, and then save the token to the database.\n\n**Workflow 2**. Develop your primary workflow to fetch or post data to/from your application. Observe the logic to include an if condition when an error occurs with an invalid token. This triggers the third workflow to refresh the token.\n\n**Workflow 3**. This workflow will handle the token refresh. Remember to send the unique ID to the webhook to fetch the necessary tokens from your table.\n\nDetailed demonstration of the workflow:\nhttps://youtu.be/6nXi_yverss","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":29,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.supabase":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":9},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.stopAndError":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Priya Jain","username":"processease","bio":"","verified":false,"links":["https://www.priyajain.tech"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/3b27a0755c3e1570fc0885c2a140cda0abdf0dbdd2fa3085d7e9a14651bbe6fb?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2319,"template_name":"Better Oauth2.0 workflow for Pipedrive CRM with Supabase","unique_visitors":551,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":112,"unique_inserters":67,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":19},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2320","wf_detais":{"id":2320,"name":"Invoice data extraction with LlamaParse and OpenAI","createdAt":"2024-07-09T10:24:28.654Z","description":"This n8n workflow automates the process of parsing and extracting data from PDF invoices.

After submitting a Google Form, the user receives a notification via WhatsApp. These notifications are sent via a template message.\n2. In case user sends a message to the bot, the text and user data is stored in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-B0yepcrCHxQpn7Sj6QjTa0VqwwVBQhO5ZcIUSxWJE/edit?resourcekey=&gid=1621824221#gid=1621824221).\n3. To reply back to the user, fill in the `ReplyText` column and change the Status to 'Ready'. In a few seconds n8n will fetch the unsent replies and deliver them one by one via WhatsApp Business node.\n\nCustomize this workflow to fit your specific needs, connect different online services and enhance your customer communication! 🎉\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\nTo get this workflow up and running, you'll need to:\n\n1. 👇 Create a WhatsApp template message on the Meta Business portal. <details>![messagetemplate.png](fileId:817)</details>\n\n2. Obtain an Access Token and WhatsApp Business Account ID from the Meta Developers Portal. This is needed for the **WhatsApp Business Node** to send messages.\n![credentialssetup.png](fileId:815)\n\n3. Set up a **WhatsApp Trigger** node with App ID and App Secret from the Meta Developers Portal.\n![credentialswebhook.png](fileId:814)\n\n4. Right after that copy the **WhatsApp Trigger** URL and add it as a Callback URL in the Meta Developers Portal. This trigger is needed to receive incoming messages and their status updates.\n![credentialstrigger.png](fileId:816)\n\n5. Connect your Google Sheets account for data storage and management. Check out the [documentation page](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).\n\n## ⚠️ Important Notes\n\n- WhatsApp allows automatic *custom text* messages only within 24 hours of the last user message. Outside with time frame only *approved template messages* can be sent.\n- The workflow uses a Google Sheet to manage form submissions, incoming messages and prepare responses. You can replace these nodes and connect the WhatsApp bot with other systems.","categories":[{"id":13,"name":"Support"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":15,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.whatsApp":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.whatsAppTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheetsTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Eduard","username":"eduard","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/parsadanyan/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a551e67c6fe7affd5f882a527dee154bb6c3ac90cf878326accb3fb3ec77c8a6?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2340,"template_name":"🚀 Boost your customer service with this WhatsApp Business bot!","unique_visitors":14016,"unique_weekly_visitors":11,"unique_monthly_visitors":3849,"unique_inserters":1511,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":386},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2341","wf_detais":{"id":2341,"name":"Build a Tax Code Assistant with Qdrant, Mistral.ai and OpenAI","createdAt":"2024-07-11T10:41:27.677Z","description":"This n8n workflows builds another example of creating a knowledgebase assistant but demonstrates how a more deliberate and targeted approach to ingesting the data can produce much better results for your chatbot.\n\nIn this example, a government tax code policy document is used. Whilst we could split the document into chunks by content length, we often lose the context of chapters and sections which may be required by the user.\n\nOur approach then is to first split the document into chapters and sections before importing into our vector store. Additionally, using metadata correctly is key to allow filtering and scoped queries.\n\n## Example\n\n**Human**: \"Tell me about what the tax code says about cargo for intentional commerce?\"\n\n**AI**: \"Section 11.25 of the Texas Property Tax Code pertains to \"MARINE CARGO CONTAINERS USED EXCLUSIVELY IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE.\" In this section, a person who is a citizen of a foreign country or an en...\"\n\n## How it works\n\n* The tax code policy document is downloaded as a zip file from the government website and its pages are extracted as separate chapters.\n* Each chapter is then parsed and split into its sections using data manipulation expressions.\n* Each section is then inserted into our Qdrant vector store tagged with its source, chapter and section numbers as metadata.\n* When our AI Agent needs to retrieve data from our vector store, we use a custom workflow tool to perform the query to Qdrant.\n* Because we're relying on Qdrant's advanced filtering capabilities, we perform the search using the Qdrant API rather than the Qdrant node.\n* When the AI Agent, needs to pull full wording or extracts, we can use Qdrant's scroll API and metadata filtering to do so. This makes Qdrant behave like a key-value store for our document.\n\n## Requirements\n* A Qdrant instance is required for the vector store and specifically for it's filtering functionality.\n* Mistral.ai account for Embeddings and AI models.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n\nDepending on your use-case, consider returning actual PDF pages (or links) to the user for the extra confirmation and to build trust.\n\nNot using Mistral?

And it works both ways.\n\n### What events are supported?\n\nEverything except recurring events.\n\nAll day events, multiple day events, start and end date… these are all supported.\n\nYou set them in Notion and they stay in sync with Google. And vice versa.\n### Why doesn’t it support recurring events?\n\nNotion doesn’t support recurring events yet.\n\nSo when you create a recurring event in Google, it will only consider the first date, ignoring future occurrences of the event.\n\n### Can I connect more than one Notion database?\n\nYes. You can have many Notion databases synced to one Google Calendar account.\n\nYou can see how to do it in the workflow instructions.\n\nIt is recommended that you create more calendars in your account, so that you can link each calendar to a different database in Notion. But that’s a choice.\n![image 1.png](fileId:823)\n\n### What happens if I delete an event or page?\n\n- Notion page deleted → Deletes event in Google\n- Notion date property cleared → Deletes event in Google\n- Google event deleted → Clears the date property in Notion, but keeps the page, so you don’t lose your work.\n\n### Does it update the events?\n\nYes. When you update the event in Google or in Notion it syncs both ways.\n\n### How can I know what Notion item was linked to an event?\n\nEither by the name or by clicking the hyperlink in the event description that says: **👉 View in Notion**.\n\n\n### When I create a new event in Google, does it add an item to Notion?\n\nYes. When you create an event inside one of your calendars, the item is synced to the corresponding Notion database.\n\n### Does it sync event descriptions?\n\nNo. The event description will always be “View in Notion”. Even if you change it in Google Calendar it will be overwritten when you make a change to the Notion page.\n\n🎉 When you buy this template you receive step-by-step instructions on how to set it up.\n\n### Check out my other templates\n👉 [**https://n8n.io/creators/solomon/**](https://n8n.io/creators/solomon/)","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":127,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":16},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.notion":{"count":16},"n8n-nodes-base.dateTime":{"count":10},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":29},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":15},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.notionTrigger":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.googleCalendar":{"count":9},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleCalendarTrigger":{"count":6}}}},"user":{"name":"Solomon","username":"solomon","bio":"Freelance consultant from Brazil, specializing in automations and data analysis.

This way you can refer to other chats from the history.\n\nThe final message is relayed back to slack as a new message. Since we can not wait longer than 3000 ms for slack response, we will create a new message with reference to the input we passed.\n\nWe can advance this using the tools or data sources for it to be more custom tailored for your company.\n\n## Usage\nTo use the slackbot, go to slack and click on your set slash command eg /Bob and send your desired message.\n\nThis will send the message to your endpoint and get return the processed results as the message.\n\nIf you would like help setting this up, feel free to reach out to zacharia@effibotics.com ","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":10,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatGoogleGemini":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Imperol","username":"imperolq","bio":"Automation expert with years of experience helping businesses improve their efficiency and productivity with smart automations that are affordable, scalable, and flexible.

Thats where the mapping between an automatically generated Gmail Alias and a Notion Database URL, including the personal API Token, happens.\n- Using a Gmail Trigger, new entries are split by the Email Alias, so the corresponding route can be retrieved from the Database connected to the portal.\n- Every Email then gets processed by AI to get generate an actionable task and get a short summary of the original Email as well as some metadata.\n- Based on a predefined structure a new Page is created in the corresponding Notion Database.\n- Finally the Email is marked as “processed” in Gmail.\n- If an error happens, the route gets paused for a possible overflow and the user gets notified by Email.\n\n## Setup\n\n- Create a new Google account (alternatively you can use an existing one and set up rules to keep your inbox organized)\n- Create two Labels in Gmail: “Processed” and “Error”\n- Clone [this Softr template including the Airtable dataset](https://studio.softr.io/dashboard?template_id=164f2a23-00c8-4e6b-8bb7-b413b8df6f3a) and publish the application\n- Clone this workflow and choose credentials (Gmail, Airtable)\n- Follow the additional instructions provided within the workflow notes\n- Enable the workflow, so it runs automatically in the background\n\n## How to use\n\n- Open published Softr application\n- Register as a new user\n- Create a new route containing the Notion API key and the Notion Database URL\n- Expand the new entry to copy the Email address\n- Save the address as a new contact in your Email provider of choice\n- Forward an Email to it and watch how it gets converted to an actionable task\n\n## Disclamer\n\n- Airtable was chosen, so you can setup this template fairly quickly. It is advised to replace the persistence by something you own, like a self hosted SQL server, since we are dealing with sensitive information of multiple users\n- This solution is only meant for building internal tools, unless you own an embed license for n8n.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":38,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.airtable":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":13},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmailTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolCalculator":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserStructured":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Mario","username":"octionic","bio":"Workflow Optimization Expert | Software Architect.

This isn't likely to work without some tinkering, but should be a good head start on receiving/routing IOT/MQTT messages and hooking up to a Spotify-like API.\n## Requirements\n* An IOT device capable of generating events that can be delivered as MQTT messages through an MQTT Broker\n  * e.g. [Ikea Strybar remote](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/styrbar-remote-control-smart-white-80488370/)\n* An MQTT Broker to which n8n can connect and consume messages\n  * e.g. Zigbee2MQTT in HomeAssistant\n* A Spotify **developer-account** (which provides access to API functions via OAuth2 authorization)\n* A Spotify **user-account** (which provides access to Spotify streamed content, user settings, etc.)\n\n## Setup\n1. Create an MQTT Credential item in n8n and assign it to the MQTT Trigger node\n1. Modify the MQTT trigger node to match the topic for your IOT device messages\n1. Modify the switch/router nodes to map to the message text from your IOT button (e.g. arrow_left_click, brightness_up_click, etc.)\n1. Create a Spotify **developer-account** (or use the login for a **user-account**)\n1. Create an \"App\" in the **developer-account** to represent the n8n workflow\n    * Chicken/Egg ALERT: The n8n Spotify Credentials dialog box will display the \"OAuth Redirect URL\" required to create the App in Spotify, but the n8n Credential item itself cannot be created until AFTER the App has been created.\n1. Create a Spotify Credentials item in n8n\n    * Open the Settings on the Spotify App to find the required Client ID and Client Secret information.\n    * ALERT: Save this before proceeding to the Connect step.\n1. Connect the n8n Spotify Credential item to the Spotify **user-account**\n    * ALERT: Expect n8n to open a separate OAuth2 window on authorization.spotify.com here, which may require a login to the Spotify **user-account**\n1. Open each of the HTTP and Spotify nodes, one by one, and re-assign to **your** Spotify Credential (try not to miss any).\n    * (Then, probably, upvote this feature request: [https://community.n8n.io/t/select-credentials-via-expression/5150](https://community.n8n.io/t/select-credentials-via-expression/5150)\n1. Modify the variable values in the Globals node to match your own environment.\n    * target_spotify_playback_device_name - The name of a playback device available to the Spotify user-account\n    * favorite_playlist_name - The name of a playlist to start when one of the button actions is indicated in the MQTT message.  Used in example \"Custom Function 2\" sequence.\n\n## Notes\n* You're on your own for getting the multi-button remote switch talking to MQTT, figuring out what the exact MQTT topic name is, and mapping the message parts to the workflow (actions, etc.).\n* The next / previous actions are wired up to **not** transfer control to the target device. This alternative routing just illustrates a different behavior than the remaining actions/functions, which include activation of the target device when required.\n* Some of the Spotify API interactions use the Spotify node in n8n, but many of the available Spotify API functions are limited or not implemented at all in the Spotify node.  So, in other cases, a regular HTTP node is used with the Spotify OAuth2 API credential instead.  By modifying one of the examples included in the template, it should be possible to call nearly anything the Spotify API has to offer.\n\n## Spotify+n8n OAuth Mini-Tutorial\n### Definitions\n* The **developer-account** is the Spotify login for creating a **spotify-app** which will be associated with a **client id** and **client secret**.\n* The **user-account** is the Spotify login that has permission to stream songs, set up playback devices, etc.\n* ++A **spotify-login** allows access to a Spotify **user-account**, _or_ a Spotify **developer-account**, **_OR BOTH_**++\n* The **spotify-app**, which has a **client id** and **client secret**, is an object created in the **developer-account**.\n* The **app-implementation** (in this case, an ++n8n workflow++) uses the **spotify-app's** credentials (client id / client secret) to call Spotify API endpoints **on behalf of** a **user-account**.\n\n### Using One Spotify Login as Both User and Developer\nWhen an n8n _Spotify-node_ or _HTTP-node_ (i.e. an **app-implementation**) calls a Spotify API endpoint, the Credentials item **may** be using the **client id and client secret** from a **spotify-app**, which was created in a **developer-account** that is ++**one and the same _spotify-login_** as the **user-account**++.  However, it helps to remind yourself that from the Spotify API server's perspective, the **developer-account + spotify-app**, and the **user-account**, are ++**two independent entities**++.\n\n### n8n Spotify-OAuth2-API Credential Authorization Process\nThe **2** layers/steps, in the process of authorizing an n8n Spotify-OAuth2-API credential to make API calls, are:\n1. n8n must identify itself to Spotify as the **app-implementation** associated with the **developer-account/spotify-app** by sending the app's credentials (client id and client secret) to Spotify.\n    * The Client ID and Client Secret are supplied in the n8n Spotify OAuth2 Credentials UI/dialog-box\n2. Separately, n8n must obtain an authorization token from Spotify to represent the **permissions granted by the user** to execute actions (call API endpoints) **on behalf of** the user (i.e. access things that belong to the **user-account**).\n    * This authorization for the **user-account** access is obtained when the \"Connect\" or \"Reconnect\" button is clicked in the n8n Spotify Credentials UI/dialog-box (which pops up a separate authorization UI/browser-window managed by Spotify).\n    * The Authorization for a given **spotify-app** stays \"registered\" in the **user-account** until revoked.\n      * See: https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-on-other-apps/\n      * Direct Link: https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/\n    * More than one **user-account** _can_ be authorized for a given **spotify-app**. A particular n8n Spotify-OAuth2-API credential item appears to cache an authorization token for the **user-account** that was **_most recently_** authorized.\n      * Up to 25 users can be allowed access to a **spotify-app** in Developer-Mode, but any **user-account** other than the one associated with the **developer-account** must be added by email address at **https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/**_{{app-credential-id}}_**/users**\n    * **ALERT:** IF the browser running the n8n UI is ALSO logged into a Spotify account, and the **spotify-app** is already authorized for that Spotify account, the \"reconnect\" button in the Spotify-OAuth2-API credential dialog may automatically grab a token for that logged in **user-account**, offering no opportunity to select a different **user-account**.\n      * This can be managed somewhat by using \"incognito\" browser windows for n8n, Spotify, or both.\n\n### References\n* [n8n Spotify Credentials Docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/spotify/)\n* [Spotify Authorization Docs](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization)\n\n","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":26,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.spotify":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.mqttTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Hubschrauber","username":"hubschrauber","bio":"Software developer specializing in \"back-end plumbing\" to connect and sync data between large corporate systems, enabling application distribution/migration, scaling, and containerization.

When an employee sends a direct message (DM) to the IT department's Slack channel, the workflow is triggered. The initial step involves the \"Receive DMs\" node, which listens for new messages. Upon receiving a message, the workflow verifies the webhook by responding to Slack's challenge request, ensuring that the communication channel is active and secure.\n\nOnce the webhook is verified, the workflow checks if the message sender is a bot using the \"Check if Bot\" node. If the sender is identified as a bot, the workflow terminates the process to avoid unnecessary actions. If the sender is a human, the workflow sends an acknowledgment message back to the user, confirming that their query is being processed. This is achieved through the \"Send Initial Message\" node, which posts a simple message like \"On it!\" to the user's Slack channel.\n\nThe core functionality of the workflow is powered by the \"AI Agent\" node, which utilizes the OpenAI GPT-4 model to interpret and respond to the user's query. This AI-driven node processes the text of the received message, generating an appropriate response based on the context and information available. To maintain conversation context, the \"Window Buffer Memory\" node stores the last five messages from each user, ensuring that the AI agent can provide coherent and contextually relevant answers.\n\nAdditionally, the workflow includes a custom Knowledge Base (KB) tool ([see that tool template here](https://n8n.io/workflows/2398-kb-tool-confluence-knowledge-base/)) that integrates with the AI agent, allowing it to search the company's internal KB for relevant information. After generating the response, the workflow cleans up the initial acknowledgment message using the \"Delete Initial Message\" node to keep the conversation thread clean. Finally, the generated response is sent back to the user via the \"Send Message\" node, providing them with the information or assistance they requested. This workflow effectively automates the IT support process, reducing response times and improving efficiency.\n\nTo quickly deploy the Knowledge Ninja app in Slack, use the app manifest below and don't forget to replace the two sample urls:\n\n```\n{\n    \"display_information\": {\n        \"name\": \"Knowledge Ninja\",\n        \"description\": \"IT Department Q&A Workflow\",\n        \"background_color\": \"#005e5e\"\n    },\n    \"features\": {\n        \"bot_user\": {\n            \"display_name\": \"IT Ops AI SlackBot Workflow\",\n            \"always_online\": true\n        }\n    },\n    \"oauth_config\": {\n        \"redirect_urls\": [\n            \"Replace everything inside the double quotes with your slack redirect oauth url, for example: https://n8n.domain.com/rest/oauth2-credential/callback\"\n        ],\n        \"scopes\": {\n            \"user\": [\n                \"search:read\"\n            ],\n            \"bot\": [\n                \"chat:write\",\n                \"chat:write.customize\",\n                \"groups:history\",\n                \"groups:read\",\n                \"groups:write\",\n                \"groups:write.invites\",\n                \"groups:write.topic\",\n                \"im:history\",\n                \"im:read\",\n                \"im:write\",\n                \"mpim:history\",\n                \"mpim:read\",\n                \"mpim:write\",\n                \"mpim:write.topic\",\n                \"usergroups:read\",\n                \"usergroups:write\",\n                \"users:write\",\n                \"channels:history\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"settings\": {\n        \"event_subscriptions\": {\n            \"request_url\": \"Replace everything inside the double quotes with your workflow webhook url, for example: https://n8n.domain.com/webhook/99db3e73-57d8-4107-ab02-5b7e713894ad\",\n            \"bot_events\": [\n                \"message.im\"\n            ]\n        },\n        \"org_deploy_enabled\": false,\n        \"socket_mode_enabled\": false,\n        \"token_rotation_enabled\": false\n    }\n}\n\n```\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":20,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":9},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolWorkflow":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Angel Menendez","username":"djangelic","bio":"Angel Menendez is a Staff Developer Advocate at n8n.io, specializing in low-code tools for cybersecurity workflows.

Create a new table in Airtable and give it a field *time* with type date, *orderID* with type number, and *orderPrice* also with type number. \n 2. Create a new access token if you haven't already at https://airtable.com/create/tokens/new. Make sure to give the token the scopes *data.records:read*, *data.records:write*, *schema.bases:read* and access to whichever table you choose to store the orders. A pop-up window appears with the token. Use this token to make `Create New Credential` > `Access Token` for Airtable in the `Store Order` and `Airtable Get Today's Orders` nodes.\n 3. Create access credentials for your Gmail as described here: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials. Use the credentials from your *client_secret.json* in the `Send to Gmail` node.\n 4. In the `Store Order` node, change *Base* and *Table* to the database and table in your Airtable account you wish to use to store orders. Make sure to use these same values in the `Airtable Get Today's Orders` node.\n 5. Every time an order is created in your system, send a POST request to Webhook from your order software. Each request must contain a single order containing fields *'orderID'* and *'orderPrice'* (or, edit `Set Order Fields` to select which incoming fields you wish to save)\n 6. Change the schedule time for sending email from `Everyday at 7PM` to whichever time you choose. \n \n\n## Test:\n- Activate the workflow.\n- From the node `Webhook`, copy *Production URL*\n- Send the following CURL request to the URL given to you:\n` curl -X POST   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"   -d '{\"orderID\": 12345, \"orderPrice\": 99.99}' YOUR_URL_HERE`\n- It should say *Node executed successfully*.

In the LLM node's options, we'll define 2 \"user message\" inputs with the type of binary (data) for our images.\n* Finally, we'll prompt our LLM with our testing criteria and capture the regressions detected.

This allows for much more accurate data extraction from the document especially when it comes to tables and complex layouts.\n\nMultimodal Parsing is better than traditiona OCR because:\n* It reduces complexity and overhead by avoiding the need to preprocess the document into text format such as markdown before passing to the LLM.\n* It handles non-standard PDF formats which may produce garbled output via traditional OCR text conversion.\n* It's orders of magnitude cheaper than premium OCR models that still require post-processing cleanup and formatting. LLMs can format to any schema or language you desire!\n\n## How it works\n\nYou can use the example bank statement created specifically for this workflow here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wS9U7MQDthj57CvEcqG_Llkr-ek6RqGA/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wS9U7MQDthj57CvEcqG_Llkr-ek6RqGA/view?usp=sharing)\n\n* A PDF bank statement is imported via Google Drive. For this demo, I've created a mock bank statement which includes complex table layouts of 5 columns. Typically, OCR will be unable to align the columns correctly and mistake some deposits for withdrawals.\n* Because multimodal LLMs do not accept PDFs directly, well have to convert the PDF to a series of images. We can achieve this by using a tool such as [Stirling PDF](https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF/). Stirling PDF is self-hostable which is handy for sensitive data such as bank statements.\n* Stirling PDF will return our PDF as a series of JPGs (one for each page) in a zipped file. We can use n8n's decompress node to extract the images and ensure they are ordered by using the Sort node.\n* Next, we'll resize each page using the Edit Image node to ensure the right balance between resolution limits and processing speed.\n* Each resized page image is then passed into the Basic LLM node which will use our multimodal LLM of choice - Gemini 1.5 Pro. In the LLM node's options, we'll add a \"user message\" of type binary (data) which is how we add our image data as an input.\n* Our prompt will instruct the multimodal LLM to transcribe each page to markdown. Note, you do not need to do this - you can just ask for data points to extract directly! Our goal for this template is to demonstrate the LLMs ability to accurately read the page.\n* Finally, with our markdown version of all pages, we can pass this to another LLM node to extract required data such as deposit line items.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Google Gemini API for Multimodal LLM.\n* Google Drive access for document storage.\n* [Stirling PDF](https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF) instance for PDF to Image conversion\n\n## Customising the workflow\n\n* At time of writing, Gemini 1.5 Pro is the most accurate in text document parsing with a relatively low cost. If you are not using Google Gemini however you can switch to other multimodal LLMs such as OpenAI GPT or Antrophic Claude. \n\n* If you don't need the markdown, simply asking what to extract directly in the LLM's prompt is also acceptable and would save a few extra steps.\n\n* Not parsing any bank statements any time soon? This template also works for Invoices, inventory lists, contracts, legal documents etc.","categories":[{"id":8,"name":"Finance"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":20,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.sort":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.editImage":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.compression":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatGoogleGemini":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.informationExtractor":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Jimleuk","username":"jimleuk","bio":"Freelance consultant based in the UK specialising in AI-powered automations.

It's easy to customize—add app nodes before the AI Agent step to pass additional context, or modify the Apple Shortcut to send inputs like text, geolocation, images, or files.\n\n![Siri Template Thumbnail](https://uploads.n8n.io/devrel/siri-template-thumb.png)\n\n### Set Up\nBasic instructions in template itself.\n\n### Requirements\n- **n8n account** (cloud or self-hosted)\n- **Apple Shortcuts app** on iOS or macOS. Dictation (\"Siri\") must be activated. Download the [Shortcuts template here](https://uploads.n8n.io/devrel/ask-agent-v1.shortcut).\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Voice-Controlled AI:** Trigger AI Agent via Siri for real-time voice replies.\n- **Customizable Inputs:** Modify Apple Shortcut to send text, images, geolocation, and more.\n- **Flexible Outputs:** Siri can return the AI’s response as text, files, or customize it to trigger CRUD actions in connected apps.\n- **Context-Aware:** Automatically feeds the current date and time to the AI Agent, with easy options to pass in more data.\n\n\n### How It Works:\n1. **Activate Siri** and speak your request.  \n2. Siri sends the transcribed text to the n8n workflow via Apple Shortcuts.  \n3. **AI Agent** processes the request and generates a response.  \n4. Siri reads the response, or the workflow can return geolocation, files, or even perform CRUD actions in apps.\n\n\n### Inspiration: Custom Use Cases\nTweak this template and make it your own.\n- **Capture Business Cards:** Snap a photo of a business card and record a voice note. Have the AI Agent draft a follow-up email in Gmail, ready to send.\n- **Voice-to-Task Automation:** Speak a new to-do item, and the workflow will add it to a Notion task board.\n- **Business English on the Fly:** Convert casual speech into polished business language, and save the refined text directly to your pasteboard, ready to be pasted into any app. \"It's late because of you\" -&gt; \"There has been a delay, and I believe your input may have contributed to it.\"\n\n","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":6,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Max Tkacz","username":"max-n8n","bio":"Principal Product Designer @ n8n","verified":true,"links":["https://n8n.io"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/c8f1965a9ff2bef51826e127081be880010ce5f0e3a3fc8ffd54e944d58bd2df?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2436,"template_name":"Siri AI Agent: Apple Shortcuts powered voice template","unique_visitors":4265,"unique_weekly_visitors":6,"unique_monthly_visitors":764,"unique_inserters":1073,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":180},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2437","wf_detais":{"id":2437,"name":"Convert image to text using GROQ LLaVA V1.5 7B","createdAt":"2024-09-27T16:54:17.011Z","description":"## What this template does\nThis template uses GROQ LLAVA V1.5 7B API that offers fast inference for multimodal models with vision capabilities for understanding and interpreting visual data from images. .\n\nThe users send a image and get a description of the image from the model.\n\n## Setup\n- Open the Telegram app and search for the BotFather user (@BotFather)\n- Start a chat with the BotFather\n- Type /newbot to create a new bot\n- Follow the prompts to name your bot and get a unique API token\n- Save your access token and username\n- Once you set your bot, you can send the image, and get the descriptions.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegramTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"felipe biava cataneo","username":"felipecataneo","bio":"Engineer who likes to code as hobby","verified":false,"links":[""],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8c041ff6cc6d215ecd9033b0492456aac69765528401522577a110a78bc8eed9?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2437,"template_name":"Convert image to text using GROQ LLaVA V1.5 7B","unique_visitors":1787,"unique_weekly_visitors":2,"unique_monthly_visitors":401,"unique_inserters":403,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":77},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2438","wf_detais":{"id":2438,"name":"Find out which Chrome extensions are tracked by Linkedin ","createdAt":"2024-09-28T07:17:35.065Z","description":"## What this workflow does\n**Linkedin tracks which Chrome extensions are installed in your browser.**  This workflow uses a huge raw JSON of chrome extension ids, extracted from Linkedin pages, and builds a pretty Google Sheet with the list of these extensions.

You can also connect the supervisor to your already existing Agents.\n\n## Demo & Explanation\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/qe23D1hgLwY/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/qe23D1hgLwY)\n\n## How it works\n- After recording a message in the Vagent App, it gets transcribed and sent in combination with a session ID to the registered webhook\n- The Main Agent acts as a router. I interprets the message while using the stored chat history (bound to the session ID) and chooses which tool to use to perform the required action and. Tools on this level are workflows, which contain subordinated Agents. Since the Main Agent interprets the original message, the raw input is passed to the Tools/Sub-Agents as a separate parameter\n- Within the Sub-Agents the actual processing takes place. Each of those has it’s separate chat memory (with a suffix to the main session ID), to achieve a clear separation of concerns\n- Depending on the required action an HTTP Request Tool is called. The result is being formatted in Markdown and returned to the Main Agent with an additional short prompt, so it does not get interpreted by the Main Agent.\n- Drafts are separated from a short message by added indentation (angle brackets). If some information is missing, no tool is called just yet, instead a message is returned back to the user\n- The Main Agent then outputs the result from the called Sub-Agent. If a draft is included, it gets separated from the spoken output\n- Finally the formatted output is returned as response to the webhook. The message is split into a spoken and a text version, which enables the App to read out loud unnecessary information like drafts in this example\n\nSee the full documentation of Vagent: [https://vagent.io/docs](https://vagent.io/docs)\n\n## Setup\n- Import this workflow into your n8n instance\n- Follow the instructions given in the sticky notes on the canvas\n- Setup your credentials. OpenAI can be replaced by another LLM in the workflow, but is required for the App to work. Google Calendar and Notion are required for all scenarios to work\n- Copy the Webhook URL from the Webhook node of the main workflow\n- Download the Vagent App from [https://vagent.io](https://vagent.io)\n- In the settings paste your OpenAI API Token, the Webhook URL and the password defined for Header Auth\n- Now you can use the App to interact with the Multi-Agent using your Voice by tapping the Mic symbol in the App to record your message.\n\n*To use the chat trigger (for testing) properly, temporarily disable the nodes after the Tools Agent.*","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":28,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":3},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolWorkflow":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolHttpRequest":{"count":3},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":3}}}},"user":{"name":"Mario","username":"octionic","bio":"Workflow Optimization Expert | Software Architect.

Then this n8n workflow in combination with an iOS shortcut will definitely help you. Once set up, you can use a shortcut, which can be stored as an app icon on your home screen, to record the start, end and duration of your break.\n\n## How it works\nOnce setup you can tap the iOS shortcut on your iPhone. You will see a menu containing three options: \"Track Start\", \"Track Break\" and \"Track End\". After time is tracked iOS will display you a notification about the successful operation.\n\n## How to set it up\n1. Copy the [notion database](https://unitize.notion.site/1117f2f5baf98054b33befb4d8a3c7ab?v=9b428f93c7d2451095728c1aeddbcb16) to your notion workspace (Top right corner).\n2. Copy the n8n workflow to your n8n workspace\n3. In the notion nodes in the n8n workflow, add your notion credentials and select the copied notion database.\n4. Download the iOS Shortcut from our [documentation page](https://unitize.notion.site/Time-Tracking-with-Notion-and-iOS-shortcut-1137f2f5baf9807f85fdf3f542da2427)\n5. Edit the shortcut and paste the url of your n8n Webhook trigger node to the first \"Text\" node of the iOS shortcut flow.\n6. It is a best practice to use authentication. You can do so by adding \"Header\" auth to the webhook node and to the shrotcut.\n\n---\n### You need help implementing this or any other n8n workflow?\nFeel free to contact me via LinkedIn or [my business website](https://www.nodemation.de).\n\n### You want to start using n8n?\nUse this link to [register for n8n](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/edr9c63lw12z)\n(This is an affiliate link)\n\n---\n","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":30,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":9},"n8n-nodes-base.notion":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"David","username":"unitize","bio":"You need help implementing a custom n8n workflow?\nFeel free to contact me via LinkedIn or my business website: unitize.de\n\nYou want to start using n8n?\nUse this affiliate link: https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/edr9c63lw12z","verified":false,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-moors-95b9061b5/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a9e5671c86ac556ed95d8c8f614afea1e67c3b09b507da53c15df3137b3910f8?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2447,"template_name":"Time Tracking with Notion and iOS shortcut","unique_visitors":351,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":90,"unique_inserters":46,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":13},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2448","wf_detais":{"id":2448,"name":"Masked Email Management for Fastmail","createdAt":"2024-10-02T18:03:32.846Z","description":"## Template Description\n\nThis n8n workflow is designed to manage Fastmail masked email addresses using the Fastmail API. The workflow provides the following functionalities:\n\n1. **Retrieve all masked emails**: Fetches all masked email addresses associated with the Fastmail account.\n2. **Create masked email**: Allows creating a new masked email with a specified state (`pending`, `enabled`, etc.).\n3. **Update masked email state**: Updates the state of a masked email such as enabling, disabling, or deleting it.\n4. **Generate HTML template**: Constructs an HTML table to display the masked emails in a user-friendly format.\n\n## Steps to Make it Work\n\n1. **Webhook Node**: \n   - This node listens for incoming requests to manage masked emails.\n   - Needs Basic Authentication credentials to secure the endpoint.\n\n2. **Session Node**: \n   - Sends a request to obtain session information from Fastmail's API.\n   - Requires an HTTP Header Auth credential with your Fastmail API token.\n\n3. **Switch Node**: \n   - Routes the workflow based on the state of the incoming masked email request (`pending`, `enabled`, `disabled`, `deleted`).\n   \n4. **HTTP Request Nodes**:\n   - These nodes handle various Fastmail API calls for masked emails (get, set, update, delete).\n   - All HTTP Request nodes require an HTTP Header Auth credential attached, using the Fastmail API token.\n\n5. **Set Node**: \n   - Gathers the retrieved masked email list into an array for further processing.\n\n6. **HTML Node**: \n   - Generates an HTML template to render the masked email addresses in a table format.\n\n7. **Respond to Webhook Node**: \n   - Sends back the HTML table to the client in response to the webhook request.\n\n### Needed Credentials\n\n1. **Fastmail Masked E-Mail Addresses**:\n   - An API token from Fastmail's API.\n   - Each HTTP call to Fastmail requires this credential for authentication.\n\n## Note\n\n- Ensure that you correctly configure authentication for the API calls and webhook security.\n- Use your actual Fastmail API credentials with the correct scope.\n- The workflow assumes that the Fastmail API is correctly configured and accessible from your n8n instance.\n- Update URLs and credentials IDs according to your n8n configuration.","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":11,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.html":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Vitali","username":"vquie","bio":"","verified":true,"links":[""],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/9547a27c5842ef984e096548285dc3d902bdecaad51c800b6f100a068a2fc9f0?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2448,"template_name":"Masked Email Management for Fastmail","unique_visitors":132,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":29,"unique_inserters":16,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":4},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2450","wf_detais":{"id":2450,"name":"One-way sync Stripe Invoice PDFs to a S3 Bucket","createdAt":"2024-10-04T22:05:26.222Z","description":"This automation syncs your Invoice PDFs from Stripe to a (AWS) S3 Bucket each month, in a folder of your choice, with the following subPath:\n\n*yourFolder/invoiceYear/invoiceMonth/fileName*\n\n\nFill in your **Credentials and Settings** in the Nodes marked with _\"*\"_.\n\nYou can adjust this Workflow to your needs.

While this workflow is production-ready if all steps are followed, adding error handling would enhance its robustness.\n\n## Important notes\n\n- **Check legal regulations**: This workflow involves scraping, so make sure to check the legal regulations around scraping in your country before getting started. Better safe than sorry!\n- **Mind those tokens**: OpenAI tokens can add up fast, so keep an eye on usage unless you want a surprising bill that could knock your socks off! 💸\n\n## Main Workflow\n\n### Node 1 - `Webhook`\nThis node triggers the workflow via a webhook call. You can replace it with any other trigger of your choice, such as form submission, a new row added in Google Sheets, or a manual trigger.\n\n### Node 2 - `Get Rows from Google Sheet`\nThis node retrieves the list of companies from your spreadsheet. The columns in this Google Sheet are:\n\n- **Company**: The name of the company\n- **Website**: The website URL of the company  \n  *These two fields are required at this step.*\n\n- **Business Area**: The business area deduced by OpenAI from the scraped data\n- **Offer**: The offer deduced by OpenAI from the scraped data\n- **Value Proposition**: The value proposition deduced by OpenAI from the scraped data\n- **Business Model**: The business model deduced by OpenAI from the scraped data\n- **ICP**: The Ideal Customer Profile deduced by OpenAI from the scraped data\n- **Additional Information**: Information related to the scraped data, including:\n  - **Information Sufficiency**:\n    - *Description*: Indicates if the information was sufficient to provide a full analysis.\n    - *Options*: \"Sufficient\" or \"Insufficient\"\n  - **Insufficient Details**:\n    - *Description*: If labeled \"Insufficient,\" specifies what information was missing or needed to complete the analysis.\n  - **Mismatched Content**:\n    - *Description*: Indicates whether the page content aligns with that of a typical company page.\n  - **Suggested Actions**:\n    - *Description*: Provides recommendations if the page content is insufficient or mismatched, such as verifying the URL or searching for alternative sources.\n\n### Node 3 - `Loop Over Items`\nThis node ensures that, in subsequent steps, the website in \"extra workflow input\" corresponds to the row being processed. You can delete this node, but you'll need to ensure that the \"query\" sent to the scraping workflow corresponds to the website of the specific company being scraped (rather than just the first row).\n\n### Node 4 - `AI Agent`\nThis AI agent is configured with a prompt to extract data from the content it receives. The node has three sub-nodes:\n  \n  - **OpenAI Chat Model**: The model used is currently `gpt4-o-mini`.\n  - **Call n8n Workflow**: This sub-node calls the workflow to use ScrapingBee and retrieves the scraped data.\n  - **Structured Output Parser**: This parser structures the output for clarity and ease of use, and then adds rows to the Google Sheet.\n\n### Node 5 - `Update Company Row in Google Sheet`\nThis node updates the specific company's row in Google Sheets with the enriched data.\n\n## Scraper Agent Workflow\n\n### Node 1 - `Tool Called from Agent`\nThis is the trigger for when the AI Agent calls the Scraper. A query is sent with:\n- Company name\n- Website (the URL of the website)\n\n### Node 2 - `Set Company URL`\nThis node renames a field, which may seem trivial but is useful for performing transformations on data received from the AI Agent.\n\n### Node 3 - `ScrapingBee: Scrape Company's Website`\nThis node scrapes data from the URL provided using ScrapingBee. You can use any scraper of your choice, but ScrapingBee is recommended, as it allows you to configure scraper behavior directly. Once configured, copy the provided \"curl\" command and import it into n8n.\n\n### Node 4 - `HTML to Markdown`\nThis node converts the scraped HTML data to Markdown, which is then sent to OpenAI. The Markdown format generally uses fewer tokens than HTML.\n\n## Improving the Workflow\nIt's always a pleasure to share workflows, but creators sometimes want to keep some magic to themselves ✨. Here are some ways you can enhance this workflow:\n\n- Handle potential errors\n- Configure the scraper tool to scrape other pages on the website. Although this will cost more tokens, it can be useful (e.g., scraping \"Pricing\" or \"About Us\" pages in addition to the homepage).\n- Instead of Google Sheets, connect directly to your CRM to enrich company data.\n- Trigger the workflow from form submissions on your website and send the scraped data about the lead to a Slack or Teams channel.\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":13,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.markdown":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolWorkflow":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserStructured":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Dataki","username":"dataki","bio":"I am passionate about transforming complex processes into seamless automations with n8n.

Wish you could filter through them quickly using AI but the decks are unparseable through conventional means? Then you're in luck!\n\nThis n8n template uses Multimodal LLMs to parse and extract valuable data from even the most overly designed pitch decks in quick fashion. Not only that, it'll also create the foundations of a RAG chatbot at the end so you or your colleagues can drill down into the details if needed. With this template, you'll scale your capacity to find interesting companies you'd otherwise miss!\n\n**Requires n8n v1.62.1+**\n\n## How It Works\n\n* Airtable is used as the pitch deck database and PDF decks are downloaded from it.\n* An AI Vision model is used to transcribe each page of the pitch deck into markdown.\n* An Information Extractor is used to generate a report from the transcribed markdown and update required information back into pitch deck database.\n* The transcribed markdown is also uploaded to a vector store to build an AI chatbot which can be used to ask questions on the pitch deck.\n\nCheck out the sample Airtable here: [https://airtable.com/appCkqc2jc3MoVqDO/shrS21vGqlnqzzNUc](https://airtable.com/appCkqc2jc3MoVqDO/shrS21vGqlnqzzNUc)\n\n### How To Use\n* This template depends on the availability of the Airtable - make a duplicate of the airtable ([link](https://airtable.com/appCkqc2jc3MoVqDO/shrS21vGqlnqzzNUc)) and its columns before running the workflow.\n* When a new pitchdeck is received, enter the company name into the **Name** column and upload the pdf into the **File** column. Leave all other columns blank.\n* If you have the Airtable trigger active, the execution should start immediately once the file is uploaded. Otherwise, click the manual test trigger to start the workflow.\n* When manually triggered, all \"new\" pitch decks will be handled by the workflow as separate executions.\n\n## Requirements\n* OpenAI for LLM\n* Airtable For Database and Interface\n* Qdrant for Vector Store\n\n## Customising This Workflow\n\n* Extend this starter template by adding more AI agents to validate claims made in the pitch deck eg.

The bot leverages OpenAI's assistant to interact with users and stores user data in Supabase for personalized conversations.\n\n### What problem does this workflow solve?\n\nMany simple chatbots lack context awareness and user memory. This workflow solves that by integrating Supabase to keep track of user sessions (via ```telegram_id``` and ```openai_thread_id```), allowing the bot to maintain continuity and context in conversations, leading to a more human-like and engaging experience.\n\n### What this workflow does\n\nThis Telegram bot template connects with OpenAI to answer user queries while storing and retrieving user information from a Supabase database. The memory component ensures that the bot can reference past interactions, making it suitable for use cases such as customer support, virtual assistants, or any application where context retention is crucial.\n\n1.**Receive New Message:** The bot listens for incoming messages from users in Telegram.\n2. **Check User in Database:** The workflow checks if the user is already in the Supabase database using the ```telegram_id```.\n3. **Create New User (if necessary):** If the user does not exist, a new record is created in Supabase with the telegram_id and a unique ```openai_thread_id```.\n4. **Start or Continue Conversation with OpenAI:** Based on the user’s context, the bot either creates a new thread or continues an existing one using the stored ```openai_thread_id```.\n5. **Merge Data:** User-specific data and conversation context are merged.\n6. **Send and Receive Messages:** The message is sent to OpenAI, and the response is received and processed.\n7. **Reply to User:** The bot sends OpenAI’s response back to the user in Telegram.\n\n\n### Setup\n\n1. **Create a Telegram Bot** using the [Botfather](https://t.me/botfather) and obtain the bot token.\n2. **Set up Supabase:**\n\t1. Create a new project and generate a ```SUPABASE_URL``` and ```SUPABASE_KEY```.\n\t2.

Under the hood, utilise n8n's powerful AI features to handle different message types and use an AI agent to respond to the user. A powerful tool for any use-case!\n\n## How it works\n* Incoming WhatsApp Trigger provides a way to get messages into the workflow.\n* The message received is extracted and sent through 1 of 4 branches for processing.\n* Each processing branch uses AI to analyse, summarize or transcribe the message so that the AI agent can understand it. The supported types are **text**, **image**, **audio (voice notes)** and **video (no sound)**.\n* The AI Agent is used to generate a response generally and uses a wikipedia tool for more complex queries.\n* Finally, the response message is sent back to the WhatsApp user using the WhatsApp node.\n\n## How to use\nOnce you have setup and configured your WhatsApp account, you'll need to activate your workflow to start processing messages.\n\n**Good to know:** Large media files may negatively impact workflow performance.\n\n## Requirements\n* WhatsApp Buisness account\n* OpenAI for LLM\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* For performance reasons, consider processing audio and video using dedicated services.\n* To handle videos with sound, you have 2 choices: use an LLM like Gemini which fully supports video processing (though video input is not currently supported in LLM node) or split the video into a image track and audio track and process separately. Good luck! \n* Go beyond and create rich and engagement customer experiences by responding using images, audio and video instead of just text!","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":36,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.whatsApp":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":9},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.convertToFile":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.whatsAppTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":3},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":4},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolWikipedia":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Jimleuk","username":"jimleuk","bio":"Freelance consultant based in the UK specialising in AI-powered automations.

This allows parallel processing.\n* A report is generated from the issue using its comment history allowing the issue to be classified by AI - determining the state and progress of the issue.\n* If determined to be resolved, sentiment analysis is performed to track customer satisfaction. If negative, a slack message is sent to escalate, otherwise the issue is closed automatically.\n* If no response has been initiated, an AI agent will attempt to search and resolve the issue itself using similar resolved issues or from the notion database. If a solution is found, it is posted to the issue and closed.\n* If the issue is blocked and waiting for responses, then a reminder message is added.\n\n## How to use\n\n* This template searches for JIRA issues which are older than 7 days which are not in the \"Done\" status. Ensure there are some issues that meet this criteria otherwise adjust the search query to suit.\n* Works best if you frequently have long-lived issues that need resolving.\n* Ensure the notion tool is configured as to not read documents you didn't intend it to ie. private and/or internal documentation.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* JIRA for issues management\n* OpenAI for LLM\n* Slack for notifications\n\n## Customising this workflow\n\n* Why not try classifying issues as they are created?

Import the workflow into your n8n workspace\n2. Customize the endpoint paths by tweaking the 'Path' parameters in the 'Webhook' and 'Webhook (with ID)' nodes (currently *customers*)\n3. Set up your Airtable credentials by following [this guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/) and customize the Airtable nodes by selecting your base, table, and the correct fields to update. *...or...* replace the Airtable nodes and connect the endpoint to any other service (e.g. Postgres, MySQL, Notion, Coda)\n\n\n# How to use the workflow\n\n1.

Struggling to quickly identify the next big startup because these decks are too design-heavy for traditional parsing tools?\n\nYou’re in luck! This n8n template leverages multimodal LLMs to efficiently extract key information from even the most intricate pitch decks. Not only does it analyze content at scale, but it also builds the foundation for a RAG chatbot—so you and your team can explore deeper insights at any time. With this solution, you’ll never miss the hidden gems again!\n\n## Requirements\n- n8n v1.62.1+\n- OpenAI (for LLM)\n- Airtable (as the pitch deck database)\n- Qdrant (for the vector store)\n\n## How It Works\nAirtable serves as the pitch deck repository, where uploaded PDFs are stored.\nAn AI Vision model transcribes each PDF page into markdown.\nThe markdown is processed by an Information Extractor, which generates a summary and updates key fields in Airtable.\nThe markdown content is also indexed into Qdrant, creating a searchable AI chatbot that lets you interact with the pitch deck data.\n📋 Sample Airtable: View Example Here\n\n## How To Use\n1. Duplicate the Airtable: Use the template above to create your own Airtable with the same structure.\n2. Upload a Pitch Deck: Add the company name in the Name column and upload the PDF into the File column. Leave other fields blank.\n3. Trigger Workflow:\nIf the Airtable trigger is enabled, the workflow starts automatically when a new file is uploaded.\nYou can also manually trigger the workflow to process any \"new\" pitch decks in bulk.\nEach pitch deck will be processed individually in separate executions.\n\n## Customization Ideas\nEnhanced Validation: Add agents to verify claims from pitch decks (e.g., LinkedIn profiles, website traffic, product reviews).\nTailored Reports: Modify the extraction logic to generate customized reports for your accelerator’s needs.\nChatbot Extensions: Use the chatbot to compare multiple startups, filter based on specific criteria, or surface competitor insights.\nWith this template, you’ll scale your ability to uncover promising startups—turning overwhelming data into actionable insights in no time!","categories":[{"id":8,"name":"Finance"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":50,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.sort":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.airtable":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.editImage":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":11},"n8n-nodes-base.compression":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.airtableTool":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.convertToFile":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.airtableTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolVectorStore":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStoreQdrant":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.informationExtractor":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Abhishek Gupta","username":"codeforstartups","bio":"","verified":false,"links":["https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0126b8a691746e6696"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/dfbb0fff369350e7d6343ae4917b34a1fa14da52a6e997d9b8bf043bcb353e12?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2497,"template_name":"Streamline Your Pitch Deck Review with AI","unique_visitors":22,"unique_weekly_visitors":4,"unique_monthly_visitors":15,"unique_inserters":1,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":0},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2501","wf_detais":{"id":2501,"name":"Replace Images in Google Docs Documents and Download as PDF/Docx","createdAt":"2024-10-26T10:26:29.662Z","description":"## Use Case\nAutomate image replacement in Google Docs:\n- You need to update document images dynamically\n- You want to create multiple versions of a template with different images\n- You need to batch process document images from a URL database\n- You want to generate shareable documents with custom images\n\n## What this Workflow Does\nThe workflow automates image replacement in Google Docs:\n- Accepts image URLs from your database\n- Finds and replaces images in template documents\n- Creates new document copies with updated images\n- Optionally converts to PDF and makes documents shareable\n\n## Setup\n1.

Useful for internal linking.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Access to **Supabase** for storing embeddings.\n- Basic knowledge of **Postgres** and **pgvector**.\n- A **WordPress website** with content to be embedded.\n- An **OpenAI API key**\n- Ensure that your n8n workflow, Supabase instance, and WordPress website are set to the **same timezone** (or use GMT) for consistency.\n\n\n## Workflow 1 : Initial Embedding\n\nThis workflow retrieves your WordPress pages and posts, generates embeddings from the content, and stores them in Supabase using `pgvector`.\n\n### Step 0 : Create Supabase tables\n\n**Nodes :** \n- `Postgres - Create Documents Table`: This table is structured to support **OpenAI embedding** models with **1536 dimensions**\n- `Postgres - Create Workflow Execution History Table`\n\nThese two nodes create tables in Supabase:\n\n- The **documents** table, which stores embeddings of your website content.\n- The **n8n_website_embedding_histories** table, which logs workflow executions for efficient management of upserts. This table tracks the workflow execution ID and execution timestamp.\n\n### Step 1 : Retrieve and Merge WordPress Pages and Posts\n\n**Nodes :**\n- `WordPress - Get All Posts`\n- `WordPress - Get All Pages`\n- `Merge WordPress Posts and Pages`\n\nThese three nodes retrieve **all content and metadata from your posts and pages** and merge them. \n**Important: ** **Apply filters** to avoid generating embeddings for all site content.\n\n### Step 2 : Set Fields, Apply Filter, and Transform HTML to Markdown\n\n**Nodes :**\n- `Set Fields`\n- `Filter - Only Published & Unprotected Content`\n- `HTML to Markdown`\n\nThese three nodes prepare the content for embedding by:\n\n1. Setting up the necessary fields for content embeddings and document metadata.\n2. Filtering to include only **published** and **unprotected** content (`protected=false`), ensuring private or unpublished content is **excluded from your GenAI application**.\n3. Converting HTML to Markdown, which enhances **performance and relevance** in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by optimizing document embeddings.\n\n### Step 3: Generate Embeddings, Store Documents in Supabase, and Log Workflow Execution\n\n**Nodes**:\n- `Supabase Vector Store`\n  - **Sub-nodes**:\n    - `Embeddings OpenAI`\n    - `Default Data Loader`\n    - `Token Splitter`\n    - `Aggregate`\n- `Supabase - Store Workflow Execution`\n\nThis step involves generating embeddings for the content and storing it in Supabase, followed by logging the workflow execution details.\n\n1. **Generate Embeddings**: The `Embeddings OpenAI` node generates vector embeddings for the content.\n2. **Load Data**: The `Default Data Loader` prepares the content for embedding storage. The metadata stored includes the content title, publication date, modification date, URL, and **ID**, which is **essential for managing upserts**. \n\n\n⚠️ **Important Note :** Be cautious **not to store any sensitive information in metadata** fields, as this information will be **accessible to the AI and may appear in user-facing answers**.\n\n3. **Token Management**: The `Token Splitter` ensures that content is segmented into manageable sizes to comply with token limits.\n4. **Aggregate**: Ensure the last node is run only for 1 item.\n5. **Store Execution Details**: The `Supabase - Store Workflow Execution` node saves the workflow execution ID and timestamp, enabling tracking of when each content update was processed.\n\nThis setup **ensures that content embeddings are stored in Supabase for use in downstream applications**, while workflow execution details are logged for consistency and version tracking.\n\nThis workflow should be **executed only once for the initial embedding**. \n**Workflow 2**, described below, will **handle all future upserts**, ensuring that new or updated content is embedded as needed.\n\n## Workflow 2: Handle document upserts\n\n**Content on a website follows a lifecycle**—it may be **updated**, **new content** might be added, or, at times, content may be **deleted**. \n\nIn this **first version of the template**, the upsert workflow manages:\n- **Newly added content**\n- **Updated content**\n\n### Step 1: Retrieve WordPress Content with Regular CRON\n\n**Nodes**:\n- `CRON - Every 30 Seconds`\n- `Postgres - Get Last Workflow Execution`\n- `WordPress - Get Posts Modified After Last Workflow Execution`\n- `WordPress - Get Pages Modified After Last Workflow Execution`\n- `Merge Retrieved WordPress Posts and Pages`\n\nA **CRON job** (set to run **every 30 seconds** in this template, but you can **adjust it** as needed) initiates the workflow. A **Postgres SQL** query on the `n8n_website_embedding_histories` table retrieves the **timestamp** of the **latest workflow execution**.\n\nNext, the HTTP nodes use the **WordPress API** (**update the example URL** in the template with your own website’s URL and add your **WordPress credentials**) to request **all posts and pages modified after the last workflow execution date**. This process captures both **newly added** and **recently updated content**. The retrieved content is then merged for further processing.\n\n### Step 2 : Set fields, use filter\n\n**Nodes :**\n- `Set fields2`\n- `Filter - Only published and unprotected content`\n\nThe same that Step 2 in **Workflow 1**, except that HTML To Makrdown is used in further Step.\n\n### Step 3: Loop Over Items to Identify and Route Updated vs. Newly Added Content\n\n\n**Here, I initially aimed to use 'update documents' instead of the delete + insert approach, but encountered challenges, especially with updating both content and metadata columns together. Any help or suggestions are welcome! :)**\n\n\n**Nodes**:\n- `Loop Over Items`\n- `Postgres - Filter on Existing Documents`\n- `Switch`\n\n  - **Route `existing_documents`** (if documents with matching IDs are found in metadata):\n    - `Supabase - Delete Row if Document Exists`: Removes any existing entry for the document, preparing for an update.\n    - `Aggregate2`: Used to aggregate documents on Supabase with ID to ensure that `Set Fields3` is executed only once for each WordPress content to **avoid duplicate execution**.\n    - `Set Fields3`: Sets fields required for embedding updates.\n    \n  - **Route `new_documents`** (if no matching documents are found with IDs in metadata):\n    - `Set Fields4`: Configures fields for embedding newly added content.\n\n\nIn this step, a loop processes **each item**, directing it based on **whether the document already exists**. The **`Aggregate2`** node acts as a control to ensure `Set Fields3` runs only once per WordPress content, effectively **avoiding duplicate execution** and optimizing the update process.\n\n\n### Step 4 : HTML to Markdown, Supabase Vector Store, Update Workflow Execution Table\n\nThe **HTML to Markdown** node mirrors **Workflow 1 - Step 2**. Refer to that section for a detailed explanation on how HTML content is converted to Markdown for improved embedding performance and relevance.\n\nFollowing this, the content is **stored in the Supabase vector store** to manage embeddings efficiently. Lastly, the **workflow execution table is updated. These nodes mirros the **Workflow 1 - Step 3 nodes**.\n\n## Workflow 3 : An example of GenAI App with Wordpress Content : Chatbot to be embed on your website\n\n### Step 1: Retrieve Supabase Documents, Aggregate, and Set Fields After a Chat Input\n\n**Nodes**:\n- `When Chat Message Received`\n- `Supabase - Retrieve Documents from Chat Input`\n- `Embeddings OpenAI1`\n- `Aggregate Documents`\n- `Set Fields`\n\n\nWhen a user sends a message to the chat, the prompt (user question) is sent to the Supabase vector store retriever. The RPC function `match_documents` (created in **Workflow 1 - Step 0**) retrieves documents relevant to the user’s question, enabling a more accurate and relevant response.\n\nIn this step:\n1. The **Supabase vector store retriever** fetches documents that match the user’s question, including metadata.\n2. The **Aggregate Documents** node consolidates the retrieved data.\n3. Finally, **Set Fields** organizes the data to create a more readable input for the AI agent.\n\n**Directly using the AI agent** without these nodes would prevent metadata from being sent to the language model (LLM), but **metadata is essential for enhancing the context** and accuracy of the AI’s response. By including metadata, the **AI’s answers can reference relevant document details, making the interaction more informative**.\n\n### Step 2: Call AI Agent, Respond to User, and Store Chat Conversation History\n\n**Nodes**:\n- **AI Agent**\n  - Sub-nodes:\n    - `OpenAI Chat Model`\n    - `Postgres Chat Memories`\n- **Respond to Webhook**\n\nThis step involves calling the AI agent to generate an answer, responding to the user, and storing the conversation history.  The model used is **gpt4-o-mini**, chosen for its cost-efficiency.

The matching happens between the names (because one workflow can contain different credentials of the same type) of the original credentials and the ones available on the current instance. Every option then shows all available credentials of the same type. In addition the user has always the choice to create a new credential on the fly.\n- For every option which was set to create a new credential, an empty credential is being created on the current instance using the n8n API. An emoji is being appended to the name, which indicates that it needs to be populated.\n- Finally the workflow gets updated with the new credential ID’s and created on the current instance using the n8n API. Then the user gets a message, if the process has succeeded or not.\n\n## Setup\n\n- Select your credentials in the nodes which require those\n- Configure your remote instance(s) in the Settings node. (You can skip this step, if you only want to use the File Upload feature)\n    - Every instance is defined as object with the keys *name*, *apiKey* and *baseUrl*. Those instances are then wrapped inside an array. You can find an example described within a note on the workflow canvas.\n\n## How to use\n\n- Grab the (production) URL of the Form from the first node\n- Open the URL and follow the instructions given in the multi-form\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n- Security: Beware, that all credentials are being decrypted and processed within the workflow. Also the API keys to other n8n instances are stored within the workflow.\n- This solution is primarily meant for transferring data between testing environments. For production use consider the n8n enterprise edition which provides a **reliable** way to deploy workflows between different environments without the need of manual credential mapping.","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":58,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.n8n":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.form":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.sort":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.renameKeys":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":21},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.removeDuplicates":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Mario","username":"octionic","bio":"Workflow Optimization Expert | Software Architect.

To achieve this, SQL queries are made outside the AI Agent node, and the results are never passed back to the agent.\n\nThis approach allows the agent to generate SQL queries based on the structure of tables and their relationships, without having to access the actual data.\n\nThis makes the process more secure and efficient, especially in cases where data confidentiality is crucial.\n\n### 🚀 Setup\n\nTo get started with this workflow, you’ll need to set up a free MySQL server and import your database (check Step 1 and 2 [in this tutorial](https://blog.n8n.io/compare-databases/)). \n\n*Of course, you can switch MySQL to another SQL database such as PostgreSQL, the principle remains the same. The key is to download the schema once and save it locally to avoid repeated remote connections.*\n\nRun the top part of the workflow once to download and store the MySQL chinook database schema file on the server.\n\nWith this approach, we avoid the need to repeatedly connect to a remote db4free database and fetch the schema every time. As a result, we reach greater processing speed and efficiency.\n\n### 🗣️ Chat with your data\n\n1. Start a chat: send a message in the chat window.\n2. The workflow loads the locally saved MySQL database schema, without having the ability to touch the actual data. The file contains the full structure of your MySQL database for analysis.\n3. The Langchain AI Agent receives the schema, your input and begins to work.\n4. The AI Agent generates SQL queries and brief comments based solely on the schema and the user’s message.\n5. An IF node checks whether the AI Agent has generated a query. When:\n- Yes: the AI Agent passes the SQL query to the next MySQL node for execution.\n- No: You get a direct answer from the Agent without further action.\n\n6. The workflow formats the results of the SQL query, ensuring they are convenient to read and easy to understand.\n7. Once formatted, you get both the Agent answer and the query result in the chat window.\n\n### 🌟 Example queries\n\nTry these sample queries to see the schema-driven AI Agent in action:\n\n1.  Would you please list me all customers from Germany?\n\n2.  What are the music genres in the database?\n\n3. What tables are available in the database?\n\n4. Please describe the relationships between tables. - In this example, the AI Agent does not need to create the SQL query.\n\nAnd if you prefer to keep the data private, you can manually execute the generated SQL query in your own environment using any database client or tool you trust 🗄️\n\n💭 The AI Agent memory node does not store the actual data as we run SQL-queries outside the agent. It contains the database schema, user questions and the initial Agent reply. Actual SQL query results are passed to the chat window, but the values are not stored in the Agent memory.\n","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":29,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.mySql":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":9},"n8n-nodes-base.convertToFile":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Yulia","username":"yulia","bio":"Let's connect!

This is especially useful for generating disposable email addresses for privacy-conscious users or for testing purposes.\n\n#### Workflow Details:\n1. **Webhook Trigger**: The workflow is initiated by sending a POST request to a specific webhook. You can include `state` and `description` in your request body to customize the masked email's state and description.\n2. **Session Retrieval**: The workflow makes an HTTP request to the Fastmail API to retrieve session information. It uses this data to authenticate further requests.\n3. **Create Masked Email**: Using the retrieved session data, the workflow sends a POST request to Fastmail's JMAP API to create a masked email. It uses the provided state and description from the webhook payload.\n4. **Prepare Output**: Once the masked email is successfully created, the workflow extracts the email address and attaches the description for further processing.\n5. **Respond to Webhook**: Finally, the workflow responds to the original POST request with the newly created masked email and its description.\n\n#### Requirements:\n- **Fastmail API Access**: You will need valid API credentials for Fastmail configured with HTTP Header Authentication.\n- **Authorization Setup**: Optionally set up authorization if your webhook is exposed to the internet to prevent misuse.\n- **Custom Webhook Request**: Use a tool like `curl` or create a shortcut on macOS/iOS to send the POST request to the webhook with the necessary JSON payload, like so:\n  \n  ```bash\n  curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://your-n8n-instance/webhook/87f9abd1-2c9b-4d1f-8c7f-2261f4698c3c -d '{\"state\": \"pending\", \"description\": \"my mega fancy masked email\"}'\n  ```\n\nThis template simplifies the process of integrating masked email functionality into your projects or workflows and can be extended for various use cases.\n\nFeel free to use the companion shortcut I've also created.

It is triggered when someone fills out the modal popup in slack generated by the `Qualys Slack Shortcut Bot`.\n\nWhen deploying this workflow, use the Demo Data node to simulate the data that is input via the Execute Workflow Trigger. That data flows into the Global Variables Node which is then referenced by the rest of the workflow. \n\nIt includes nodes to Fetch the Report IDs and then Launch a report, and then check the report status periodically and download the completed report, which is then posted to Slack for easy access. \n\nFor Security Operations Centers (SOCs), this workflow provides significant benefits by automating tedious tasks, ensuring timely updates, and facilitating efficient data handling.\n\n## How It Works\n\n- **Fetch Report Templates:** The \"Fetch Report IDs\" node retrieves a list of available report templates from Qualys. This automated retrieval saves time and ensures that the latest templates are used, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of reports.\n  \n- **Convert XML to JSON:** The response is converted to JSON format for easier manipulation. This step simplifies data handling, making it easier for SOC analysts to work with the data and integrate it into other tools or processes.\n  \n- **Launch Report:** A POST request is sent to Qualys to initiate report generation using specified parameters like template ID and report title. Automating this step ensures consistency and reduces the chance of human error, improving the reliability of the reports generated.\n  \n- **Loop and Check Status:** The workflow loops every minute to check if the report generation is complete. Continuous monitoring automates the waiting process, freeing up SOC analysts to focus on higher-priority tasks while ensuring they are promptly notified when reports are ready.\n  \n- **Download Report:** Once the report is ready, it is downloaded from Qualys. Automated downloading ensures that the latest data is always available without manual intervention, improving efficiency.\n  \n- **Post to Slack:** The final report is posted to a designated Slack channel for quick access. This integration with Slack ensures that the team can promptly access and review the reports, facilitating swift action and decision-making.\n\n\n## Get Started\n\n- Ensure your [Slack](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=node_settings_modal-credential_link&utm_campaign=n8n-nodes-base.slack) and [Qualys](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=node_settings_modal-credential_link&utm_campaign=n8n-creds-base.qualysApi) integrations are properly set up.\n- Customize the workflow to fit your specific reporting needs.\n- Link to parent workflow\n\n\n## Need Help?\n\n- Join the discussion on our Forum or check out resources on Discord!\n\n\nDeploy this workflow to streamline your security report generation process, improve response times, and enhance the efficiency of your security operations.","categories":[{"id":29,"name":"SecOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":22,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.xml":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Angel Menendez","username":"djangelic","bio":"Angel Menendez is a Staff Developer Advocate at n8n.io, specializing in low-code tools for cybersecurity workflows.

It ensures your droplet snapshots stay organized and within a manageable limit, preventing unnecessary storage costs due to an excess of snapshots.\n\n### Who is this for?\nThis workflow is perfect for users managing DigitalOcean Droplets and looking to automate the process of snapshot creation and cleanup to save on storage costs and maintain efficient resource management. It’s useful for DevOps teams, cloud administrators, or any developer leveraging DigitalOcean for their infrastructure.\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving?\nWhen managing multiple DigitalOcean Droplets, snapshots can quickly accumulate, taking up space and increasing storage costs. Manually deleting and creating snapshots can be time-consuming and inefficient. This automation solves this problem by automating the snapshot management process, ensuring that no more than a defined number of snapshots are kept per droplet.\n\n### What this workflow does\n1. **Runs every 48 hours**: The workflow is triggered by a cron node that runs every 48 hours, ensuring timely snapshot management.\n2. **List all droplets**: The workflow retrieves all droplets in the DigitalOcean account.\n3. **Retrieve snapshots**: For each droplet, the workflow retrieves a list of existing snapshots.\n4. **Filter snapshots**: If the number of snapshots exceeds 4, the workflow filters for snapshots that need to be deleted.\n5. **Delete snapshots**: Excess snapshots are automatically deleted based on the filter criteria.\n6. **Create new snapshot**: After cleaning up, the workflow creates a new snapshot for each droplet, ensuring that backups are always up-to-date.\n\n### Setup\n1. **DigitalOcean API Key**: You’ll need to configure the HTTP Request nodes with your DigitalOcean API key. This key is required for authenticating requests to list droplets, retrieve snapshots, delete snapshots, and create new ones.\n2. **Snapshot Threshold**: By default, the workflow is set to keep no more than 4 snapshots per droplet. This can be adjusted by modifying the filter node conditions.\n3. **Set Execution Frequency**: The cron node is set to run every 48 hours, but you can adjust the timing to suit your needs.\n\n### How to customize this workflow\n- **Adjust Snapshot Limit**: Change the value in the filter node if you want to keep more or fewer snapshots.\n- **Modify Run Frequency**: The workflow runs every 48 hours by default. You can change the frequency in the cron node to run more or less often.\n- **Enhance with Notifications**: You can add a notification node (e.g., Slack or email) to alert you when snapshots are deleted or created.\n\n### Workflow Summary\nThis workflow automates the management of DigitalOcean Droplet snapshots by keeping the number of snapshots under a defined limit, deleting the oldest ones, and ensuring new snapshots are created at regular intervals.\n","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":17,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.cron":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":11},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4}}}},"user":{"name":"Darryn","username":"optimus01","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["http://onlinethinking.io/community/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/7c20cc4f6cea0480e0e7d58353274476e195d6ec8926a3a6709bb217e7f03713?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2485,"template_name":"Automate Droplet Snapshots on DigitalOcean","unique_visitors":180,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":68,"unique_inserters":20,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":8},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2520","wf_detais":{"id":2520,"name":"Summarize Umami data with AI (via Openrouter) and save it to Baserow","createdAt":"2024-11-02T07:13:06.199Z","description":"## Who's this for?\n- Anyone who wants to improve the SEO of their website\n- Umami users who want insights on how to improve their site\n- SEO managers who need to generate reports weekly\n\n![Screenshot 20241102 at 3.00.47 PM.png](fileId:859)![Screenshot 20241102 at 3.01.13 PM.png](fileId:860)\n\n## Case study\n\nYou can [read more about how this works here.](https://rumjahn.com/how-to-analyze-umami-data-using-n8n-and-a-i-to-improve-seo-and-uncover-hidden-insights-for-better-content-optimization/)\n\n\n## How it works\n- This workflow calls the Umami API to get data \n- Then it sends the data to A.I. for analysis\n- It saves the data and analysis to Baserow\n\n## How to use this\n- Input your Umami credentials\n- Input your website property ID\n- Input your Openrouter.ai credentials\n- Input your baserow credentials\n- You will need to create a baserow database with columns: Date, Summary, Top Pages, Blog (name of your blog).\n\n## Future development\n- Use this as a template.

A final form ending indicates if that action succeeded or not.\n\n## Setup\n\n- Select your credentials in the nodes which require those\n- Configure your remote instance(s) in the Settings node\n    - Every instance is defined as object with the keys *name*, *apiKey* and *baseUrl*. Those instances are then wrapped inside an array. You can find an example described within a note on the workflow canvas.\n\n## How to use\n\n- Grab the (production) URL of the Form from the first node\n- Open the URL and follow the instructions given in the multi-form\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n- Please note, that this workflow can only run on self-hosted n8n instances, since it requires the Execute Command Node.\n- Security: Beware, that all credentials are being decrypted and processed within the workflow. Also the API keys to other n8n instances are stored within the workflow.\n- This solution is primarily meant for transferring data between testing environments.

It runs every hour to ensure continuous monitoring and up-to-date vulnerability management, making it ideal for Security Operations Centers (SOCs).\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n- **Set Global Variables:** Initializes necessary global variables like `base_url` and `newtimestamp`. This step ensures that the workflow operates with the correct configuration and up-to-date timestamps. Ensure to change the `Global Variables` to match your environment. \n  \n- **Fetch Reports from Qualys:** Sends a GET request to the Qualys API to retrieve finished reports. Automating this step ensures timely updates and consistent data retrieval.\n  \n- **Convert XML to JSON:** Converts the XML response to JSON format for easier data manipulation. This transformation simplifies further processing and integration into TheHive.\n  \n- **Filter Reports:** Checks if the reports have already been processed using their creation timestamps. This filtering ensures that only new reports are handled, avoiding duplicates.\n  \n- **Process Each Report:** Loops through the list of new reports, ensuring each is processed individually. This step-by-step handling prevents issues related to bulk processing and improves reliability.\n  \n- **Create Case in TheHive:** Generates a new case in TheHive for each report, serving as a container for the report data. Automating case creation improves efficiency and ensures that all relevant data is captured.\n  \n- **Download and Attach Report:** Downloads the report from Qualys and attaches it to the respective case in TheHive. This automation ensures that all data is properly archived and easily accessible for review.\n\n\n**Get Started:**\n\n- Ensure your [Qualys](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=node_settings_modal-credential_link&utm_campaign=n8n-creds-base.qualysApi) and [TheHive](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.thehiveproject/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=node_settings_modal-credential_link&utm_campaign=n8n-nodes-base.theHiveProject) integrations are properly set up.\n- Customize the workflow to fit your specific vulnerability management needs.\n\n\n**Need Help?**\n\n- Join the discussion on our Forum or check out resources on Discord!\n\n\nDeploy this workflow to streamline your vulnerability management process, improve response times, and enhance the efficiency of your security operations.","categories":[{"id":29,"name":"SecOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":23,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.n8n":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.xml":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.theHiveProject":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Angel Menendez","username":"djangelic","bio":"Angel Menendez is a Staff Developer Advocate at n8n.io, specializing in low-code tools for cybersecurity workflows.

Normally sub-workflows would need to be run synchronously, in series, or, if they are executed asynchronously (to run concurrently, in parallel), there is no easy way to merge/wait for an arbitrary number of them to complete.\n\nThis is a \"design pattern\" template to show one approach for running multiple, data-driven instances of a sub-workflow \"asynchronously,\" in parallel (instead of running them one at a time in series), but still prevent the later steps in the workflow from continuing until all of the sub-workflows have reported back that they are finished, via callback URL.  There are other techniques involving messaging services, database tables, or other external \"flow manager\" helpers, but this technique accomplishes the goal fully within n8n.\n\n## Setup\nTo implement this pattern, examine the nodes in the template and modify the incoming data leading to:\n1. A split-out loop to acynchronously execute a sub-workflow multiple times, in parallel.\n    * For instance, each sub-workflow might process one of a list of incoming documents.\n    * The resumeUrl for the main/parent workflow is provided to all of the sub-workflow executions, along with a unique identifier that can be counted later (e.g. a document file-name).\n2. A \"wait-for-all\" loop that checks whether all sub-workflows have reported back (`if` node) and builds a unique list of identifiers from the callbacks received from each execution of the sub-workflow.\n    * The sub-workflow should be designed to respond immediately (async) and later send a callback request when it has finished processing.\n    * The callback request should include the unique identifier value received when the sub-workflow it was started.\n\nThis is meant to be a possible answer to questions like [this one about running things in parallel](https://community.n8n.io/t/is-it-possible-to-run-a-part-of-the-workflow-in-parallel/60221),  maybe [this one about waiting for things to finish](https://community.n8n.io/t/node-does-not-wait-for-predecessor-node-always-need-a-merge-node/60773), [this one about managing sub-batches of things by waiting for each batch](https://community.n8n.io/t/maximum-parallel-subworkflows/60052), or [this one about running things in parallel](https://community.n8n.io/t/parallel-execution-of-bat-files/49493).  The topic of how to do this comes up A LOT, and this is one of the only techniques that (so far) seems to work.","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"},{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":18,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Hubschrauber","username":"hubschrauber","bio":"Software developer specializing in \"back-end plumbing\" to connect and sync data between large corporate systems, enabling application distribution/migration, scaling, and containerization.

It is ideal for anyone looking to streamline their social media posting process, saving time and ensuring consistent content delivery.\n\n## Use Case / Problem Solved\nManually posting images and captions on Instagram can be time-consuming, especially for businesses and content creators managing multiple accounts. This workflow automates the process from image preparation to publishing, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.\n\n## What this workflow does\n1. **Trigger Initialization**: The workflow starts with a manual trigger that can be adapted to other triggers (e.g., HTTP webhook or schedule).\n2. **Set Parameters**: The workflow includes a node that sets essential parameters, such as the image URL, Instagram business account ID, and caption.\n3. **Prepare Instagram Media**: A node prepares the media for upload using the Facebook API, sending the image and caption for pre-publication processing.\n4. **Check Media Upload Status**: The workflow verifies if the media preparation is complete.\n5. **Conditional Check**: If the media preparation is successful, the workflow proceeds to publish; otherwise, it triggers an error-handling path.\n6. **Publish Media**: The media is published on Instagram if the conditions are met.\n7. **Post-Publish Check**: The workflow checks the status after publication.\n8. **Conditional Check for Publication**: If the publication status is \"PUBLISHED,\" it triggers a success path; otherwise, it triggers a failure handling.\n9. **Email Notifications**: The workflow sends email notifications to indicate successful or unsuccessful outcomes.\n\n## Setup \n\nHere is a quick video in italian language with sub eng(https://youtu.be/obWJFJvg_6g)\n\n1. **Add API Credentials**: Ensure that valid Facebook API credentials are added and configured for use.\n2. **Permissions Required**: Ensure your app has the necessary permissions (`ads_management`, `business_management`, `instagram_basic`, `instagram_content_publish`, `pages_read_engagement`). App review may be required for external user access.\n3. **Node Configuration**: Customize the `Set Instagram Parameters` node to specify the image URL, caption, and Instagram business account ID.\n4. **Trigger Adaptation**: Adapt the initial trigger if needed to fit your workflow's requirements (e.g., schedule, webhook).\n\n## How to customize this workflow\n- **Change the Image URL and Caption**: Modify the `Set Instagram Parameters` node to change the image and caption.\n- **Trigger Customization**: Replace the manual trigger with other triggers like a webhook to automate posting based on external events.\n- **Notifications**: Adjust the email nodes to send customized messages or trigger other workflows based on the outcome.\n\n## Limitations\n- **Image Format**: Only JPEG images are supported. Extended JPEG formats such as MPO and JPS are not compatible.\n- **Unsupported Tags**: Shopping tags, branded content tags, and filters are not supported.\n- **Instagram TV**: Publishing to Instagram TV is not supported.\n- **Rate Limit**: Instagram accounts are limited to 50 API-published posts within a rolling 24-hour period. Carousels count as a single post. Check usage with `GET /{ig-user-id}/content_publishing_limit`.\n\n### Example Usage\nImagine managing a business account that needs consistent posts. You can schedule this workflow or trigger it manually to automatically post images with captions at the right time, ensuring that your audience stays engaged without manual posting efforts.","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":21,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.emailSend":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":9},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.facebookGraphApi":{"count":5}}}},"user":{"name":"Edoardo Guzzi","username":"mredodos","bio":"Automation expert with 10+ years in programming, AI, Chrome extensions, and mobile apps.

It ensures that failed API requests are retried with increasing delays, up to a specified maximum retry count. This approach helps mitigate transient errors (e.g., rate limits or temporary network issues) while maintaining workflow efficiency.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Exponential Backoff Logic**: Dynamically increases wait time between retries based on the retry count.\n- **Error Handling**: Stops the workflow and raises an error after a specified number of retries.\n- **Dynamic Waiting**: Waits for a calculated duration before each retry.\n- **Scalable Design**: Modular nodes for easy debugging and customization.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow Details\n\n### Nodes in the Workflow:\n\n1. **Trigger** (`When clicking \"Test Workflow\"`):\n   - Manually starts the workflow for testing.\n\n2. **Loop Over Items**:\n   - Iterates over multiple input items to process Google API requests row by row.\n\n3. **Google API Node (Example: Update Sheet)**:\n   - Sends a request to a Google API endpoint (e.g., updating a row in Google Sheets).\n   - On success: Moves to the next item in the loop.\n   - On error: Passes the error to the **Exponential Backoff** node.\n\n4. **Exponential Backoff**:\n   - Calculates the delay for the next retry based on the retry count.\n   - Logic:\n     ```javascript\n     const retryCount = $json[\"retryCount\"] || 0;\n     const maxRetries = 5;\n     const initialDelay = 1; // in seconds\n\n     if (retryCount &lt; maxRetries) {\n         const currentDelayInSeconds = initialDelay * Math.pow(2, retryCount);\n         return {\n             json: {\n                 retryCount: retryCount + 1,\n                 waitTimeInSeconds: currentDelayInSeconds,\n                 status: 'retrying',\n             }\n         };\n     } else {\n         return {\n             json: {\n                 error: 'Max retries exceeded',\n                 retryCount: retryCount,\n                 status: 'failed'\n             }\n         };\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Wait**:\n   - Dynamically waits for the `waitTimeInSeconds` value calculated in the Exponential Backoff node.\n   - **Configuration:**\n     - Resume: `After Time Interval`\n     - Wait Amount: `{{ $json[\"waitTimeInSeconds\"] }}`\n     - Unit: `Seconds`\n\n6. **Check Max Retries**:\n   - Evaluates whether the retry count has exceeded the maximum limit.\n   - Routes the workflow:\n     - **True**: Passes to the **Stop and Error** node.\n     - **False**: Loops back to the Google API node for retry.\n\n7. **Stop and Error**:\n   - Stops the workflow and logs the error when the maximum retry count is reached.\n\n---\n\n## Parameters\n### Configurable Settings:\n1. **Max Retries**:\n   - Defined in the Exponential Backoff node (`const maxRetries = 5`).\n   - Adjust this value based on your requirements.\n\n2. **Initial Delay**:\n   - The starting wait time for retries, defined as `1` second.\n\n3. **Google API Configuration**:\n   - Ensure your Google API node is properly authenticated and configured with the desired endpoint and parameters.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use\n1. **Import the Workflow**:\n   - Copy the workflow JSON and import it into your n8n instance.\n\n2. **Configure Google API Node**:\n   - Set up the Google API node with your credentials and target API endpoint (e.g., Google Sheets, Gmail, etc.).\n\n3. **Test the Workflow**:\n   - Manually trigger the workflow and observe the retry behavior in case of errors.\n\n4. **Monitor Logs**:\n   - Use the console logs in the Exponential Backoff node to debug retry timings and status.\n\n---\n\n## Example Scenarios\n### Scenario 1: Successful Execution\n- The Google API processes all requests without errors.\n- Workflow completes without triggering the retry logic.\n\n### Scenario 2: Transient API Errors\n- The Google API returns an error (e.g., `429 Too Many Requests`).\n- The workflow retries the request with increasing wait times.\n\n### Scenario 3: Maximum Retries Exceeded\n- The workflow reaches the maximum retry count (e.g., 5 retries).\n- An error is raised, and the workflow stops.\n\n---\n\n## Considerations\n1. **Jitter**:\n   - This workflow does not implement jitter (randomized delay) since it's not required for low-volume use cases.\n   - If needed, jitter can be added to the exponential backoff calculation.\n\n2. **Retry Storms**:\n   - If multiple workflows run simultaneously, ensure your API quotas can handle potential retries.\n\n3. **Error Handling Beyond Max Retries**:\n   - Customize the **Stop and Error** node to notify stakeholders or log errors in a centralized system.\n\n---\n\n## Customization Options\n- Adjust the maximum retry limit and delay calculation to suit your use case.\n- Add additional logic to handle specific error codes differently.\n- Extend the workflow to notify stakeholders when an error occurs (e.g., via Slack or email).\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n- **Retry Not Triggering**:\n  - Ensure the `retryCount` variable is passed correctly between nodes.\n  - Confirm that the error output from the Google API node flows to the Exponential Backoff node.\n\n- **Incorrect Wait Time**:\n  - Verify the `Wait` node is referencing the correct field for `waitTimeInSeconds`.\n\n---\n\n## Request for Feedback\nWe are always looking to improve this workflow. If you have suggestions, improvements, or ideas for additional features, please feel free to share them.

It is sent back to the AI Agent.\n\n## How to use it\n- Use an existing or create a new database.\n- For example, I've used [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/coffee-sales/versions/15?resource=download) and uploaded it to a Supabase DB.\n- Add the PostgreSQL or MySQL credentials.\n- Alternatively, you can use SQLite binary files (check [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2292-talk-to-your-sqlite-database-with-a-langchain-ai-agent/)).\n- Activate the workflow.\n- Start chatting with the AI SQL Agent.\n- If the Text Classifier considers a chart would be useful, it will generate a chart in addition to the response from the SQL Agent.\n\n## Notes\n- The full Quickchart.io specifications have not been integrated, thus there are some possible glitches (e.g., due to the size of the graph, radar graphs are not displayed properly).","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":16,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textClassifier":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Agent Studio","username":"agentstudio","bio":"We are a product studio that helps organizations leverage no-code and generative AI to automate internal processes and launch new digital products.","verified":true,"links":["https://agentstudio.io/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e9cf0d0fccead46655b11b2ce215cf14d33ecdaa2ce52828f003574c1800e77a?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2559,"template_name":"Visualize your SQL Agent queries with OpenAI and Quickchart.io","unique_visitors":3591,"unique_weekly_visitors":5,"unique_monthly_visitors":947,"unique_inserters":483,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":160},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2525","wf_detais":{"id":2525,"name":"Create Content from Form Inputs and Save it to Google Drive using AI","createdAt":"2024-11-04T20:00:09.023Z","description":"# AI Content Generator Workflow\n\n## **Introduction**\nThis workflow automates the process of creating high-quality articles using AI, organizing them in Google Drive, and tracking their progress in Google Sheets.

It is ideal for anyone looking to streamline their social media posting process, saving time and ensuring consistent content delivery.\n\n## Use Case / Problem Solved\nManually posting images and captions on Instagram can be time-consuming, especially for businesses and content creators managing multiple accounts. This workflow automates the process from image preparation to publishing, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.\n\n## What this workflow does\n1. Trigger Initialization: The workflow starts with a manual trigger that can be adapted to other triggers (e.g., HTTP webhook or schedule).\n2. Set Parameters: The workflow includes a node that sets essential parameters, such as the Bluesky account ID, image URLs, and caption.\n3. Prepare Bluesky Session: A node creates the authenticated session data used by the upload and post operations later in the workflow.\n4. Publish Media: Nodes retrieve image files from the specified URLS and uploads them as blobs to Bluesky, a necessary pre-requisite for a Bluesky post to have images attached.\n5. Post text caption + images: A node does the final call to the Bluesky API, including the text caption and relevant image references.\n\n## Setup\n1. Sign-in to Bluesky and create an [App Password](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords)\n2. Add your username and App Password to the *Define Credentials* node.\n3. Set the caption (text content) of your post in the *Set Caption* node.\n4. Set 1-4 image URLs in the *Set Images* node\n5. Adapt the initial trigger as needed to fit your workflow's requirements (e.g., schedule, webhook). \n6. Adapt the caption and images nodes to accept dynamic parameters.\n\n## Limitations\nThis workflow assumes a minimum of 1 image URL to function. If you want a text-only post, remove the whole `embed` section from the JSON in last *Post to Bluesky* node, as well as relevant image attachment nodes.\n\nThe 300-character limit in Bluesky includes the caption + hashtags + image alt text. Going over 300 will return a `Record/description must not be longer than 300 graphemes` error.","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":15,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Tom Sekula","username":"tsekula","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/b8b7167fcca1eaa6f34161bc1dc7d5b21edb402424fa5d10c606006ebafcf3b3?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2562,"template_name":"Simple Bluesky multi-image post using native Bluesky API","unique_visitors":705,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":115,"unique_inserters":114,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":21},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2564","wf_detais":{"id":2564,"name":"Automatically promote your YouTube video on X","createdAt":"2024-11-21T21:26:34.300Z","description":"# YouTube to X Post\n\n## Overview\n\nThis **n8n workflow** automates the process of promoting your latest YouTube videos on **X (formerly Twitter)**.

This is setup as a loop so the questions never stop unless the user wishes to end the interview.\n* Each answer is recorded in our session set up earlier between questions.\n* When the user requests to end the interview we break the loop and show the interview completion screen.\n* Finally, the session is then saved in a Google Sheet which can then be shared with team members and for the purpose of data analysis.\n\n## How to use\n\n* You'll need to be on a n8n instance that is accessible to your target audience. **Not technical enough to setup your own server?

By leveraging n8n core nodes, it scrapes business emails from Google Maps without relying on third-party APIs or paid services, ensuring there are no additional costs involved.\n\nIdeal for small business owners, freelancers, and agencies, this template automates the process of collecting contact information for targeted outreach, making it a powerful tool for anyone looking to scale their lead generation efforts without incurring extra expenses.\n\n## How it works\nThis template streamlines email scraping from Google Maps using only n8n core nodes, ensuring a completely free and self-contained solution. Here’s how it operates:\n\n### Input Queries\nYou provide a list of queries, each consisting of keywords related to the type of business you want to target and the specific region or subregion you’re interested in.\n\n### Iterates through Queries\nThe workflow processes each query one at a time. For each query, it triggers a sub-workflow dedicated to handling the scraping tasks.\n\n### Scrapes Google Maps for URLs\nUsing these queries, the workflow scrapes Google Maps to collect URLs of business listings matching the provided criteria.\n\n### Fetches HTML Content\nThe workflow then fetches the HTML pages of the collected URLs for further processing.\n\n### Extracts Emails\n\nUsing a Code Node with custom JavaScript, the workflow runs regular expressions on the HTML content to extract business email addresses.\n\n## Setup\n1. **Add Queries:**\nOpen the first node, \"Run Workflow\" and input a list of queries, each containing the business keywords and the target region.\n\n2. **Configure the Google Sheets Node:**\nOpen the Google Sheets node and select a document and specific sheet where the scraped results will be saved.\n\n3. **Run the workflow**:\nClick on \"Test workflow\" and watch your Google Sheets document gradually receive business email addresses. \n\n## Customize as Needed:\n\nYou can adjust the regular expressions in the Code Node to refine the email extraction logic or add logic to extract other kinds of information.","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":26,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.removeDuplicates":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Akram Kadri","username":"akramkadri","bio":"n8n Automation Freelancer\n------------------------\nContact me at: akram@digispruce.com","verified":true,"links":["https://youtube.com/@kadri_akram"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e57785a112fbcca1ac70d537a9ed5c5a68be59f808ed8b36475bde0e2c8f384b?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2567,"template_name":"Scrape business emails from Google Maps without the use of any third party APIs","unique_visitors":14991,"unique_weekly_visitors":27,"unique_monthly_visitors":6589,"unique_inserters":4271,"unique_weekly_inserters":5,"unique_monthly_inserters":1583},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2568","wf_detais":{"id":2568,"name":"Upsert huge documents in a vector store with Supabase and Notion","createdAt":"2024-11-24T18:37:24.868Z","description":"## Purpose\n\nThis workflow adds the capability to build a RAG on living data. In this case Notion is used as a Knowledge Base. Whenever a page is updated, the embeddings get upserted in a Supabase Vector Store.\n\nIt can also be fairly easily adapted to PGVector, Pinecone, or Qdrant by using a custom HTTP request for the latter two.\n\n## Demo\n\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ELAxebGmspY/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ELAxebGmspY)\n\n## How it works\n\n- A trigger checks every minute for changes in the Notion Database. The manual polling approach improves accuracy and prevents changes from being lost between cached polling intervals.\n- Afterwards every updated page is processed sequentially\n- The Vector Database is searched using the Notion Page ID stored in the metadata of each embedding. If old entries exist, they are deleted.\n- All blocks of the Notion Database Page are retrieved and combined into a single string\n- The content is embedded and split into chunks if necessary. Metadata, including the Notion Page ID, is added during storage for future reference.\n- A simple Question and Answer Chain enables users to ask questions about the embedded content through the integrated chat function\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- To setup a new Vector Store in Supabase, follow [this guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/vector-columns)\n- Prepare a simple Database in Notion with each Database Page containing at least a title and some content in the blocks section. You can of course also connect this to an existing Database of your choice.\n\n## Setup\n\n- Select your credentials in the nodes which require those\n- If you are on an n8n cloud plan, switch to the native Notion Trigger by activating it and deactivating the Schedule Trigger along with its subsequent Notion Node\n- Choose your Notion Database in the first Node related to Notion\n- Adjust the chunk size and overlap in the Token Splitter to your preference\n- Activate the workflow\n\n## How to use\n\nPopulate your Notion Database with useful information and use the chat mode of this workflow to ask questions about it. Updates to a Notion Page should quickly reflect in future conversations.","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":34,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.limit":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.notion":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.supabase":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.summarize":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":15},"n8n-nodes-base.notionTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainRetrievalQa":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStoreSupabase":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrieverVectorStore":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterTokenSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Mario","username":"octionic","bio":"Workflow Optimization Expert | Software Architect.

This example can be used in a variety of contexts where figuring out what is and isn't relevant can save a lot of time for your organisation.\n\n## How it works\n* We start with a form trigger which asks for the purpose of the appointment.\n* Instantly, we can qualify this by using a text classifier node which uses AI's contextual understanding to ensure the appointment is worthwhile. If not, an alternative is suggested instead.\n* Multi-page forms are then used to set the terms of the appointment and ask the user for a desired date and time.\n* An acknowledgement is sent to the user while an approval by email process is triggered in the background.\n* In a subworkflow, we use Gmail with the wait for approval operation to send an approval form to the admin user who can either confirm or decline the appointment request.\n* When approved, a Google Calendar event is created. When declined, the user is notified  via email that the appointment request was declined.\n\n## How to use\n* Modify the enquiry classifier to determine which contexts are relevant to you.\n* Configure the wait for approval node to send to an email address which is accessible to all appropriate team members.\n\n## Requirements\n* OpenAI for LLM\n* Gmail for Email\n* Google Calendar for Appointments\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* Not using Google Mail or Calendar?

Google Sheet is used for demonstration purposes but this could be any database.\n* Multi-page forms allow you to continue the onboarding experience with a short survey. 3 form nodes are chained to capture more details from the user which update the same row in the google sheet.\n* Finally, a form ending node shows a customised completion screen for our user.\n\nCheck out the example sheet here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W1PiFjCoiEBHHKKCRVMLmpKg4AWIy9w1dQ2Dq8qxPs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W1PiFjCoiEBHHKKCRVMLmpKg4AWIy9w1dQ2Dq8qxPs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## How to use\n* Keeping forms simple may serve to increase form completion rates. If you feel the need to add additional fields, consider breaking them up into more forms and group them contextually.\n\n## Requirements\n* Google Sheets for data capture\n* Slack for notifications\n\nFeel free to swap these out for services that you use!\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* Play with multi-form design to maximise the opportunity of getting to know the user better. That said, lengthy flows are likely to put people off.\n* Instead of showing a static completion screen, perhaps redirecting to your blog or other more interesting page.","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":12,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.form":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Jimleuk","username":"jimleuk","bio":"Freelance consultant based in the UK specialising in AI-powered automations.

You can retrieve this from dev console or ask someone technical for help!\n\n**Note**: It may be wise to switch to other LinkedIn scraping approaches which do not impersonate your own account for production.\n\n## Requirements\n* OpenAI for LLM\n* Gmail for Email\n* Google Calendar for upcoming events\n* WhatsApp Business account for notifications\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* Try adding information sources which are relevant to you and your invitees.

In the previous version, all steps inside the custom workflow tool were executed sequentially.\n\n⚠️ Note that you'd need to select the Tools Agent to work with new tools. \n\nBefore launching the template, make sure to set up your OpenAI and Telegram credentials.\n\nHere’s how the new Telegram bot works:\n\n1. Telegram Trigger listens for new messages in a specified Telegram chat. This node activates the rest of the workflow after receiving a message.\n\n2. AI Tool Agent receives input text, processes it using the OpenAI model and replies to a user. It addresses users by name and sends image links when an image is requested.\n\n3. The OpenAI GPT-4o model generates context-aware responses. You can configure the model parameters or swap this node entirely. \n\n4.  Window buffer memory helps maintain context across conversations. It stores the last 10 interactions and ensures that the agent can access previous messages within a session. Conversations from different users are stored in different buffers.\n\n5. The HTTP request tool connects with OpenAI's DALL-E-3 API to generate images based on user prompts. The tool is called when the user asks for an image.\n\n6. Telegram node tool sends generated images back to the user in a Telegram chat. It retrieves the image from the URL returned by the DALL-E-3 model. This does not happen directly, however. The response from the HTTP request tool is first stored in the Agent’s scratchpad (think of it as a short-term memory). In the next iteration, the Agent sends the updated response to the GPT model once again. The GPT model will then create a new tool request to send the image back to the user. To pass the image URL, the tool uses the [new $fromAI() expression](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/). \n\n7. Send final reply node sends the final response message created by the agent back to the user on Telegram. Even though the image was already passed to the user, the Agent always stops with the final response that comes from dedicated output.\n\n⚠️ Note, that the Agent may not adhere to the same sequence of actions in 100% of situations. For example, sometimes it could skip sending the file via the Telegram node tool and instead just send an URL in the final reply. If you have a longer series of predefined steps, it may be better to use the “old” custom workflow tool.\n\nThis template is perfect as a starting point for building AI agentic workflow.

By leveraging YouTube's search and data APIs, it gathers and analyzes video performance metrics from the past two days to provide insights into what content is gaining traction. Here's how the workflow operates:\n\n1. **Trigger Setup**: The workflow begins when a user sends a query through the `chat_message_received` node. If no niche is provided, the AI prompts the user to select or input one.\n\n2. **AI Agent (Language Model)**: The central node utilizes a GPT-based AI agent to:\n   - Understand the user's niche or content preferences.\n   - Generate tailored search terms related to the niche.\n   - Process YouTube API responses and summarize trends using insights such as common themes, tags, and audience engagement metrics (views, likes, and comments).\n\n3. **YouTube Search**: The `youtube_search` node runs a secondary workflow to query YouTube for relevant videos published within the last two days. It retrieves basic video data such as video IDs, relevance scores, and publication dates.\n\n4. **Video Details Retrieval**: The workflow fetches additional details for each video:\n   - **Video Snippet**: Metadata like title, description, and tags.\n   - **Video Statistics**: Metrics such as views, likes, and comments.\n   - **Content Details**: Video duration, ensuring only content longer than 3 minutes and 30 seconds is analyzed.\n\n5. **Data Processing**:\n   - Video metadata is cleaned, sanitized, and stored in memory.\n   - Tags, titles, and descriptions are analyzed to identify patterns and trends across multiple videos.\n\n6. **Output**: The workflow compiles insights and presents them to the user, highlighting:\n   - The most common themes or patterns within the niche.\n   - URLs to trending videos and their respective channels.\n   - Engagement statistics, helping the user understand the popularity of the content.\n\n### Key Notes for Setup:\n- **API Keys**: Ensure valid YouTube API credentials are configured in the `get_videos`, `find_video_snippet`, `find_video_statistics`, and `find_video_data` nodes.\n- **Memory Buffer**: The `window_buffer_memory` node ensures the AI agent retains context during analysis, enhancing the quality of the generated insights.\n- **Search Term Customization**: The AI agent dynamically creates search terms based on the user’s niche to improve search precision.\n\n### Use Case:\nThis workflow is ideal for YouTubers or marketers seeking data-driven inspiration for creating content that aligns with current trends, maximizing the potential to engage their audience.\n\n### Example Output:\nFor the niche \"digital marketing\":\n- Trending Topic: Videos about \"mental triggers\" and \"psychological marketing.\"\n- Tags: \"SEO,\" \"Conversion Rates,\" \"Social Proof.\"\n- Engagement: Videos with over **200K views** and high likes/comment ratios are leading trends.\n- Video links:\n  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=video_id1\n  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=video_id2","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":18,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.youTube":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolWorkflow":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Leonardo Grigorio","username":"leonardogrig","bio":"I combine my full-stack development expertise with AI automation using n8n, creating scalable workflows and seamless integrations for smarter business solutions.","verified":true,"links":["https://x.com/leonardogrig"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2bb981acd7d0e27410fb1aa4f7989788741d6faafc4e173f69847ec5e5f30e88?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2606,"template_name":"AI Youtube Trend Finder Based On Niche","unique_visitors":9781,"unique_weekly_visitors":4,"unique_monthly_visitors":3355,"unique_inserters":2133,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":550},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2607","wf_detais":{"id":2607,"name":"Research AI Agent Team with auto citations using OpenRouter and Perplexity","createdAt":"2024-12-05T04:31:18.702Z","description":"**Purpose of workflow:**\nThis AI-powered workflow is designed to automatically generate comprehensive, well-researched articles on any given topic.

It's particularly beneficial for those who need quick contextual information retrieval from text-heavy files stored in Supabase, without needing additional services like Google Drive.\n\n### What problem does this workflow solve?\nManually retrieving and analyzing specific information from large document repositories is time-consuming and inefficient. This workflow automates the process by vectorizing documents and enabling AI-powered interactions, making it easy to query and retrieve context-based information from uploaded files.\n\n### What this workflow does\nThe workflow integrates Supabase with an AI-powered chatbot to process, store, and query text and PDF files. The steps include:\n- Fetching and comparing files to avoid duplicate processing.\n- Handling file downloads and extracting content based on the file type.\n- Converting documents into vectorized data for contextual information retrieval.\n- Storing and querying vectorized data from a Supabase vector store.\n\n1. **File Extraction and Processing**: Automates handling of multiple file formats (e.g., PDFs, text files), and extracts document content.\n2. **Vectorized Embeddings Creation**: Generates embeddings for processed data to enable AI-driven interactions.\n3. **Dynamic Data Querying**: Allows users to query their document repository conversationally using a chatbot.\n\n### Setup\n\n#### N8N Workflow\n1. **Fetch File List from Supabase**:\n   - Use Supabase to retrieve the stored file list from a specified bucket.\n   - Add logic to manage empty folder placeholders returned by Supabase, avoiding incorrect processing.\n\n2. **Compare and Filter Files**:\n   - Aggregate the files retrieved from storage and compare them to the existing list in the Supabase `files` table.\n   - Exclude duplicates and skip placeholder files to ensure only unprocessed files are handled.\n\n3. **Handle File Downloads**:\n   - Download new files using detailed storage configurations for public/private access.\n   - Adjust the storage settings and GET requests to match your Supabase setup.\n\n4. **File Type Processing**:\n   - Use a Switch node to target specific file types (e.g., PDFs or text files).\n   - Employ relevant tools to process the content:\n     - For PDFs, extract embedded content.\n     - For text files, directly process the text data.\n\n5. **Content Chunking**:\n   - Break large text data into smaller chunks using the Text Splitter node.\n   - Define chunk size (default: 500 tokens) and overlap to retain necessary context across chunks.\n\n6. **Vector Embedding Creation**:\n   - Generate vectorized embeddings for the processed content using OpenAI's embedding tools.\n   - Ensure metadata, such as file ID, is included for easy data retrieval.\n\n7. **Store Vectorized Data**:\n   - Save the vectorized information into a dedicated Supabase vector store.\n   - Use the default schema and table provided by Supabase for seamless setup.\n\n8. **AI Chatbot Integration**:\n   - Add a chatbot node to handle user input and retrieve relevant document chunks.\n   - Use metadata like file ID for targeted queries, especially when multiple documents are involved.\n\n### Testing\n- Upload sample files to your Supabase bucket.\n- Verify if files are processed and stored successfully in the vector store.\n- Ask simple conversational questions about your documents using the chatbot (e.g., \"What does Chapter 1 say about the Roman Empire?\").\n- Test for accuracy and contextual relevance of retrieved results.","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":33,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.supabase":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":11},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolVectorStore":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStoreSupabase":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Mark Shcherbakov","username":"lowcodingdev","bio":"I am a business analyst with a development background, dedicated to helping small businesses and entrepreneurs leverage cloud services for increased efficiency.

Built with **AI-powered components**, the workflow leverages **semantic query generation, result re-ranking, and real-time reporting** to deliver actionable insights.\n\nIt is particularly well-suited for **real-time data retrieval**, **market research**, and any domain requiring automated yet customizable search result processing.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n\n1. **Webhook Integration for Input**:  \n   - The workflow begins with a **Webhook Node** that captures the user's search query as input, enabling seamless integration with other systems.  \n\n2. **Step 1: Semantic Query Generation** (Powered by \"Semantic Search - Query Maker\"):  \n   - Using AI (Google Gemini), the initial query is refined and transformed into a **context-aware, expert-level search query**.  \n   - The process ensures that the search engine retrieves the most relevant and precise results.\n\n3. **Step 2: Web Search Execution**:  \n   - A free Brave Search API processes the refined query to fetch search results, ensuring speed and cost efficiency.\n\n4. **Step 3: Semantic Re-Ranking of Results** (Powered by \"Semantic Search - Result Re-Ranker\"):  \n   - The workflow reranks the search results based on relevance to the original question, prioritizing the most relevant URLs dynamically.  \n   - Results are passed through **AI-powered intelligent reranking** to ensure the final output reflects optimal relevance and quality.\n\n5. **Step 4: Structured Output Generation**:  \n   - Results are converted into a well-structured, organized JSON format, ranking the **top 10 search results** with their titles, links, and descriptions.  \n   - Missing ranks (if fewer than 10 results) are handled gracefully with placeholders, ensuring consistency.\n\n6. **Step 5: Real-Time Reporting**:  \n   - The reranked search results are sent back to the user or integrated system via the Webhook Node in a **JSON-formatted response**.  \n   - Reports are highly structured and ready for downstream processing or consumption.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Features**\n\n1. **AI-Powered Query Refinement**:  \n   - Transforms basic queries into detailed, expert-level search terms for optimal results.\n\n2. **Dual-Stage Semantic Search**:  \n   - Combines **query generation** and **result reranking** for precise, high-relevance outputs.\n\n3. **Top 10 Result Reranking**:  \n   - Dynamically ranks and organizes the top 10 results based on semantic relevance to the query.\n\n4. **Customizable Integration**:  \n   - Fully modifiable for alternative APIs or integrations, such as other search engines or custom ranking logic.\n\n5. **JSON-Formatted Structured Results**:  \n   - Outputs reranked results in a standardized format, ideal for integration into systems requiring machine-readable data.\n\n6. **Webhook-Based Flexibility**:  \n   - Works seamlessly with Webhook inputs for easy deployment in diverse workflows.\n\n7. **Cost-Effective API Usage**:  \n   - Pre-integrated with the free Brave Search API, minimizing operational costs while delivering accurate search results.\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions for API Setup**\n\n1. **Brave Search API**:  \n   - Visit [api.search.brave.com](https://api.search.brave.com) to obtain a free-tier API key for web search.  \n2. **AI Integration** (Google Gemini):  \n   - Visit Google AI Studio and generate an API key for semantic query generation and reranking.  \n3. **Webhook Configuration**:  \n   - Set up the input Webhook to capture search queries and the output Webhook to deliver reranked results.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Choose This Workflow?**\n\n- **Precision and Relevance**: Combines AI-based query generation with advanced reranking for accurate results.  \n- **Fully Customizable**: Easily adapt the workflow to alternative APIs, search engines, or ranking logic.  \n- **Real-Time Insights**: Provides structured, real-time output ready for immediate use.  \n- **Scalable and Modular**: Ideal for businesses, researchers, and data analysts needing a robust, repeatable solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Tags**  \nAI Workflow, Semantic Search, Query Refinement, Search Result Reranking, Real-Time Search, Web Search Automation, Google Search, Brave Search, News Search, API Integration, Market Research, Competitive Intelligence, Business Intelligence,Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, GPT, LLM\n","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":20,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.dateTime":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatAnthropic":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatGoogleGemini":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserAutofixing":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserStructured":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Mind-Front","username":"mind-front","bio":"**Mind-Front** is a pilot project hosted at (https://www.mindfront.solutions), delivering intelligent, data-driven market reports to support strategic decision-making. \n\nTo help the n8n community, we’re sharing workflow solutions that address common automation challenges.

For optimal output, theme topics relevant to your brand.\n\n## Requirements\n* A source of text-heavy content is required to accurately breakdown the brand voice and article style. Don't have your own? Maybe try your competitors?\n* OpenAI for LLM - though I recommend exploring other models which may give subjectively better results.\n* Wordpress for blog but feel free to use other preferred publishing platforms.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* Ideally, you'd want to \"train\" your agent on material which is similar to your output ie. your social media post may not get the best results from your blog content due to differing formats.\n* Typically, this brand voice extraction exercise should run once and then be cached somewhere for reuse later.

In this demo, we've asked for the AI to identify all bunnies.\n* The coordinates are then rescaled with the original image's width and height to correctl align them.\n* Finally to measure the accuracy of the object detection, we use the \"Edit Image\" node to draw the bounding boxes onto the original image.\n\n## How to use\n* Really up to the imagination! Perhaps a form of grounding for evidence based workflows or a higher form of image search can be built.\n\n## Requirements\n* Google Gemini for LLM\n\n## Customising the workflow\n* This template is just a demonstration of an experimental version of Gemini 2.0.

Designed for efficiency and simplicity, it processes video subtitles without requiring an API key, making it an accessible solution for content analysis. The system assumes videos already have subtitles available, excluding live streams and videos without subtitle data.\n\n---\n\n### Key Features\n\n1. **Trigger Webhook:** Seamlessly receive video IDs through a webhook trigger.\n2. **Fetch Video HTML:** Retrieves the video’s HTML content directly from YouTube.\n3. **Extract Subtitles URLs:** Processes the HTML content to find and decode subtitle URLs.\n4. **Fetch Subtitles Content:** Downloads the subtitles from the decoded URLs in XML format.\n5. **Generate Analytical Report:** Utilizes an AI model to summarize and analyze the thematic essence of video content.\n   - The system supports models such as Google Gemini, OpenAI, and other compatible language models. \n   - The quality of the results may vary depending on the model used, with better models providing faster and more accurate summaries.\n   - The default prompt focuses on identifying and summarizing the main theme of the video while excluding content related to promotions, subscriptions, or sponsored content.\n6. **Return Analytical Report:** Delivers concise analytical reports as the final response to the webhook, suitable for various use cases like research, content creation, or consumption as plain text.\n\n---\n\n### Setup Instructions\n\n#### Step 1: Webhook Configuration\n- Set up the webhook URL in your external system (e.g., app, API) to send YouTube video IDs to this workflow.\n\n#### Step 2: API Access\n- Ensure that your environment has access to YouTube’s public HTML content. An API key is not required since the workflow parses publicly available data.\n\n#### Step 3: AI Integration\n- Verify the connection to the AI model used for report generation. Supported models include Google Gemini and OpenAI.\n- Note that the system can be customized by modifying the provided prompt to suit specific analysis needs.\n\n#### Step 4: Testing\n- Run a sample test with a YouTube video ID to ensure subtitles are correctly retrieved and the report is generated successfully.\n\n---\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n- **Effortless Content Analysis:** Generate thematic reports with minimal setup.\n- **No API Key Dependency:** Simplified access by leveraging YouTube’s public HTML.\n- **Actionable Insights:** Gain valuable information on video content for business, research, or personal projects.\n- **Cost Considerations:** The execution cost depends primarily on the model used and the length of the video (affecting token usage). Leveraging the free tier of Google Gemini models is recommended to minimize costs.\n- **Main Theme Extraction:** The default prompt excludes irrelevant promotional content, providing clear and focused thematic summaries.\n\nEstimated setup time: 15–20 minutes with a ready environment.\n\n---\n\n### Prompt Description\n\nThe workflow includes a customizable prompt used to process subtitles in XML format and generate analytical reports. The generated report includes:\n\n1. **Title:** A brief phrase capturing the essence of the main theme.\n2. **Body:** An analytical description of the main theme, structured into a maximum of three concise paragraphs. It focuses on summarizing key ideas, recurring themes, and connections without referencing the source explicitly (e.g., avoiding phrases like “this video”). The system also removes content related to sales, subscriptions, or promotions to maintain a clear thematic focus.\n\n---\n\n### Example Output\n\n**Title:** The Ethical Challenges of Artificial Intelligence  \n\n**Report:**  \nArtificial intelligence presents significant challenges in areas such as privacy, fairness, and automated decision-making. Its implementation in critical sectors such as healthcare, justice, and security has sparked debates about inherent biases and lack of transparency. Additionally, there is growing concern over the ethical implications of automation, including its impact on employment and the global economy.

By intercepting user requests, sourcing real-time exchange rate data via Google search results, and formatting the data into actionable responses, it obviates the reliance on third-party APIs. This efficiency renders it an indispensable instrument for diverse applications, including dynamic pricing strategies for AI-driven systems, financial data automation, and real-time currency computation within complex workflows. The workflow's architectural simplicity ensures seamless integration across professional and academic domains, optimizing both scalability and reliability.\n\n**Workflow Steps:**\n1. **Capture Conversion Query:**\n   - The workflow initiates by intercepting user input delivered as a GET request through a configured webhook. Inputs should adhere to a structured syntax, such as `5usd to mxn`, to ensure flawless processing.\n   - *Testing Tip:* Use tools like Postman or a browser to test GET requests and verify that the Webhook receives inputs correctly.\n2. **Fetch Exchange Rate:**\n   - Utilizing the HTTP Request node, a Google search query is executed to retrieve current exchange rate data. This method ensures the workflow remains economical and adaptable while circumventing API dependencies.\n3. **Extract Conversion Data:**\n   - By processing the returned HTML from Google's search results, this node extracts precise exchange rate figures and contextual information critical for accurate conversions.\n   - *Error Handling:* If extraction fails, verify that the input format is correct and update CSS selectors to reflect any changes in Google's HTML structure.\n4. **Format Currency Response:**\n   - The extracted data undergoes refinement and is formatted into a structured, user-friendly string that conveys the conversion results with clarity and precision.\n5. **Send Conversion Response:**\n   - The workflow culminates by dispatching the formatted response back to the request origin, completing the loop with efficiency and reliability.\n\n**Required Configuration:**\n- Configure the Webhook node to accommodate GET requests. The query parameters should follow the format: `https://your-webhook-url/currency-converter?q=5usd+to+mxn`.\n- Inputs must adhere strictly to the predefined syntax (e.g., `5usd to mxn`). Deviations may induce processing errors or yield erroneous outputs.\n\n**Customization Options:**\n- The **Extract Conversion Data** node’s CSS selectors can be fine-tuned to align with modifications in Google’s HTML structure, ensuring long-term operability.\n- Adjustments to the **Format Currency Response** node enable bespoke output formatting, incorporating additional metadata or altering the response structure to meet specific project requisites.\n\n**Advanced Features:**\n- This workflow’s modular design supports seamless integration into expansive systems. For instance, an e-commerce platform could employ it to dynamically localize product pricing based on user geolocation.\n- Enhanced functionality can be achieved by appending nodes to log conversions, monitor performance metrics, or trigger auxiliary workflows conditioned on conversion outputs.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n- For a query like `5usd to mxn`, the workflow generates a response formatted as: `5 USD = 95 MXN`. This output is optimized for readability and practical application.\n\n**Use Case Examples:**\n- **AI Integration:** Enables artificial intelligence agents to process real-time price conversions efficiently across diverse currencies, enhancing their computational capabilities.\n- **Financial Operations:** Automates precise currency conversions for corporate reports, international transactions, and market analytics.\n- **Personal Financial Planning:** Assists users in calculating currency conversions for investment decisions or travel budgeting with minimal manual effort.\n- **E-commerce Applications:** Facilitates dynamic price adjustments on online marketplaces, displaying localized prices to augment user experience and conversion rates.\n- **Workflow Integration:** Embeds seamlessly into larger systems, such as CRMs or ERPs, to streamline financial operations and enhance interoperability.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n- **No API Dependency:** By leveraging publicly available data from Google, the workflow eliminates the complexities and costs associated with API integration, reducing overhead and enhancing accessibility.\n- **Precision and Currency:** Ensures accurate and real-time results by querying Google directly.\n- **Flexibility:** Designed to adapt to various operational contexts and input formats, making it a versatile asset in computational and commercial applications.\n\n**Tags:**\n- `currency conversion`, `automation`, `webhook`, `data extraction`, `AI integration`, `financial automation`, `e-commerce`, `real-time data`, `scalable workflows`.","categories":[{"id":8,"name":"Finance"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":10,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.html":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Mauricio Perera","username":"rckflr","bio":"Automation consultant with over 10 years of experience specializing in AI, no-code, and workflow optimization.

This value is passed to the GraphQL node query as `$('Document').item.json.twitch` so make sure to change this based on your workflow.\n\n## How it Works:\n\nThe important nodes here are the `GrapQL` and `IF` nodes. The GrapQL queries the Twitch API, and then the output returns a document with the `stream` property. The IF node then checks if this property has a value, if `null` means the user is offline, otherwise the user is online or live.\n\n## Common Use Cases:\nYou can use this with other workflow templates to post live stream alerts to Twitter/X, Bluesky, and Discord via webhooks, etc to notify your community to join youR stream. You may also use an `LLM` node to write a custom alert based on the value of property `title`\n\n## How to adjust this template\nIf you want to check a list of Twitch channels, you can simply exchange the `Document` set node in the beginning with your list of channels.\n\n\nFor more information on the GraphQL output please see the official Twitch API documentation: [Get Streams](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/#get-streams)","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.graphql":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Roger Filomeno","username":"godie","bio":"","verified":false,"links":["https://rogverse.fyi/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/cfa1e61b39623327cd21f885d88e3a3345d1a113e734b473074a2a959512ae61?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2684,"template_name":"Check if a Twitch Stream is Live","unique_visitors":202,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":94,"unique_inserters":34,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":18},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2694","wf_detais":{"id":2694,"name":"SLL Expiry Alert with SSL-Checker.io","createdAt":"2025-01-03T12:28:32.839Z","description":"\n## Use Case\n\nManaging SSL certificates manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, often leading to unexpected downtime or security risks due to expired certificates.\n\n## What This Workflow Does\n\nThis workflow automatically monitors SSL certificates for a list of websites, checks their expiry status using SSL-Checker.io, and sends timely notifications if a certificate is about to expire.\n\n## Setup\nAdd your credentials for Google Sheets, Gmail, and SSL-Checker.io.\n\nCreate a Google Sheet with a list of URLs for the websites you want to monitor.\n\nConfigure the workflow to check the SSL status weekly.\n\nSet up email notifications to alert you when a certificate is close to expiry.\n\nActivate the workflow to automate monitoring and notification.\n\n## How to Adjust It to Your Needs\n\n- Customize the URL Source: Replace Google Sheets with another data source like Airtable or CSV files.\n- Modify Notification Thresholds: Change the expiry threshold (e.g., notify for 14 days instead of 7).\n- Add Additional Actions: Integrate with tools like Slack or Teams for team-wide notifications.\n- Automate Renewal Requests: Add a step to send renewal requests directly to your SSL provider if a certificate is nearing expiry.","categories":[{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"},{"id":29,"name":"SecOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":12,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Vishal Kumar","username":"vishalquantana","bio":"","verified":false,"links":["https://quantana.com.au/ai/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/19e625b50be6c5e0f734a6e837828341ade4fa64ca3d52321ed95ead0bf4c270?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2694,"template_name":"SSL Expiry Alert with SSL-Checker.io","unique_visitors":2633,"unique_weekly_visitors":2,"unique_monthly_visitors":854,"unique_inserters":595,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":202},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2695","wf_detais":{"id":2695,"name":"Generating New Keywords and their Search Volumes using the Google Ads API","createdAt":"2025-01-03T14:59:40.018Z","description":"## Generate new keywords for SEO with the monthly Search volumes\n\nThis workflow is an improvement on the workflows below.

It is designed to handle incoming requests dynamically and return detailed JSON responses for further usage.\n\n### **Overview**\n\nThe workflow processes a product name submitted through a webhook. It fetches the corresponding Product Hunt page, extracts and analyzes inline scripts, and structures the data into a well-defined JSON format using AI tools. The final JSON response is returned to the client through the webhook.\n\n### **Workflow Steps**\n\n#### 1. **Webhook Listener**\n\n- **Node:** Receive Product Request\n- **Function:** Captures incoming requests containing the product name to process.\n- **Details:** Accepts HTTP requests and extracts the `product` parameter from the query string, such as `&lt;custom_webhook_url&gt;/?product=epigram`.\n\n#### 2. **Fetch Product HTML**\n\n- **Node:** Fetch Product HTML\n- **Function:** Sends an HTTP request to retrieve the HTML content of the specified Product Hunt page.\n- **Details:** Constructs a dynamic URL using the product name and fetches the page data.\n\n#### 3. **Extract Inline Scripts**\n\n- **Node:** Extract Inline Scripts\n- **Function:** Parses the HTML content to extract inline scripts located within the `&lt;head&gt;` section.\n- **Details:** Excludes scripts containing `src` attributes and validates the presence of inline scripts.\n\n#### 4. **Process Data with LLM**\n\n- **Node:** Process Script with LLM\n- **Function:** Analyzes the extracted scripts using a language model to identify key product data.\n- **Details:** Processes the script to derive structured and meaningful insights.\n\n#### 5. **Refine Data with Google Gemini**\n\n- **Node:** Analyze Script with Google Gemini\n- **Function:** Leverages Google Gemini AI for enhanced analysis of script data.\n- **Details:** Ensures the extracted data is precise and enriched.\n\n#### 6. **Format Product Data to JSON**\n\n- **Node:** Format Product Data to JSON\n- **Function:** Structures the processed data into a clean JSON format.\n- **Details:** Defines a schema to ensure all relevant fields are included in the output.\n\n#### 7. **Send JSON Response to Client**\n\n- **Node:** Send JSON Response to Client\n- **Function:** Returns the final structured JSON response to the client.\n- **Details:** Sends the response back via the same webhook that initiated the request. For example, `&lt;custom_webhook_url&gt;`.\n\n### **Key Features**\n\n- **Versatile Use Cases:** This workflow can be used to gather Product Hunt data for creating blog posts or as a tool for AI agents to research products efficiently.\n- **Dynamic Processing:** Adapts to various product names through dynamic URL construction.\n- **AI Integration:** Utilizes the Gemini 1.5 8B AI model, offering reduced latency and minimal or no cost depending on the use case.\n- **Selector Independence:** Functions even if Product Hunt's DOM structure changes, as it does not rely on direct DOM selectors.\n- **Reliable Data Output:** A low temperature setting (0) and a precisely defined JSON schema ensure accurate and real data extraction.\n- **Dynamic Processing:** Adapts to various product names through dynamic URL construction.\n- **AI Integration:** Utilizes advanced language models for data extraction and refinement.\n- **Structured Output:** Ensures the output JSON adheres to a predefined schema for consistency.\n- **Error Handling:** Includes validations to handle missing or malformed data gracefully.\n\n### **Customization Options**\n\n### **Limitations**\n- **Dependency on Product Hunt:** Significant changes to the way Product Hunt loads data on its pages might require modifications to the workflow.\n- **Adaptability:** Even if changes occur, the workflow can be updated to maintain functionality due to its reliance on AI and not direct DOM selectors.\n\n\n- Modify the webhook path to suit your application.\n- Adjust the prompt for the language model to include additional fields.\n- Extend the JSON schema to capture more data fields as needed.\n\n### **Expected Output**\n\n**Performance Metrics**\n- **Response Time:** Typically ~6 seconds per product.\n- **Accuracy:** Data extracted with &gt;95% precision due to the pre-defined JSON schema.\n\n\nA JSON object containing detailed information about the specified product.

OpenAI's embedding models then generate vector embeddings for each chunk, capturing their semantic meaning.\n* Vector Database Storage: These embeddings, along with the corresponding text chunks, are stored in a Pinecone vector database.\n* Chat Interface and Query Processing: The workflow provides a simple chat interface. When you ask a question, it generates an embedding for your query using the same OpenAI model.\n* Semantic Search and Retrieval: Pinecone is queried to find the most relevant text chunks from the API spec based on the query embedding.\n* Response Generation: The retrieved chunks and your original question are fed to OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` LLM, which generates a concise, informative, and contextually relevant answer, including code snippets when applicable.\n\n## Set up steps:\n\n* Create accounts: You'll need accounts with OpenAI and Pinecone.\n* API keys: Obtain API keys for both services.\nConfigure credentials: In your n8n environment, configure credentials for OpenAI and Pinecone using your API keys.\n* Import the workflow: Import this workflow into your n8n instance.\n* Pinecone Index: Ensure you have a Pinecone index named \"n8n-demo\" or adjust the workflow accordingly.

In my experience, some developers don't check their Jira board to find out whether there are new updates on the issues or not or if some Issues need to be addressed as soon as possible. So, the developer or anyone else in other fields needs to be informed about the task as soon as possible, too. One way to send this immediate notification is through the Telegram Bot.\n\n**Setup Guide**\n\nso, first of all, you need to register a Telegram Bot in your account and obtain its token, so that we'll be able to send Telegram messages by using this token through our bot;\nafter getting your telegram bot token\n- go to the workflow and click on *one of the telegram nodes*\n- select the telegram credential or create one through the **Credential to connect with** field\n- and put the token in the token in the **Access Token** field.\n\nOk, you're done with the Telegram Side setup.\n\nthen you need the Jira accounts (team users) **accountId** and also their telegram **chatId** for the **telegram account** node so that it can find the corresponding telegram user from the assignee of the issue, put this data as following guide comments in the **telegram account** node.\n\nNow we go for the Jira side setup, you need to setup some **automation rules** as your needs.\n- go to the Jira settings and **Global automation** section, click on the *Create Rule* button\n- select the **Issue Created** trigger type in the *When* step\n- add a **Send webhook request** action, after selecting it you'll see its settings\n- go back to workflow and from the **jira-webhook** node copy the **Production URL** \n- paste it in the **Web request URL** field in the Jira action setting\n- then set the **HTTP method** field on **POST** \n- set **Web request body** on **Issue Data (Automation format)**\n- in the header section, add a new header with the name **type** and value **created** for the creation event.\n\nOK, the Jira side also is done! Now It's time to test!\n\nIf you've put your Jira **accountId** and telegram **chatId** in the **telegram account** node and of course started the telegram bot, after creating an Issue that is assigned to you, the creation notif will send to you in telegram!","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":3}}}},"user":{"name":"Abolfazl Akbarzadeh","username":"abolfazlakbarzadeh","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/9431a7ca6e0b3d3a347f8ce50087c4be7b91a8352be4450dc34897013ba2f171?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2708,"template_name":"Send Jira task notifications to Telegram user via Bot","unique_visitors":484,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":160,"unique_inserters":72,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":24},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2709","wf_detais":{"id":2709,"name":"Automated Email Optin Form with n8n and Hunter io for verification","createdAt":"2025-01-09T05:40:32.489Z","description":"## Case Study 📧\nWant to collect email subscribers without paying expensive monthly fees? 💰 This workflow creates a free email collection system with built-in email verification to ensure you only collect legitimate email addresses! ✨\n\n## Learn more:\n📺 [Watch the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgvEHwu19Rs&t=2s): \n\n📝 [Read the detailed guide](https://rumjahn.com/create-email-capture-forms-for-free-using-n8n-and-sendgrid-and-easily-grow-your-subscriber-list/)\n\n## What this workflow does 🛠️\n- Creates a customizable email collection form that can be embedded on your website 🌐\n- Verifies email addresses using Hunter.io to filter out fake or invalid emails ✅\n- Stores verified email addresses in SendGrid for your email marketing needs 📊\n- Completely free solution (except for Hunter.io's 50 free monthly credits) 🆓\n\n## Setup ⚙️\n1.

Some API’s do not support an endpoint (e.g. Todoist: completed tasks) to do so, which is why you would work with the error branch, only that this does not work well in combination with the retry functionality.\n\n## How it works\n\n- Instead of the builtin retry function of a Node a custom loop is used, to get more granular control in between the iterations\n- If the main executed node fails, the error can be filtered for an expected error, which can trigger a separate action\n- The retries only happen, if an unexpected error happened\n- The workflow only stops, if the defined amount of retries exceeded\n\n## Setup\n\n- Copy the nodes into your existing workflow\n- Replace the “Replace me” placeholder with the Node you want to apply the retry logic on\n- Follow the sticky notes for more instructions and optional settings","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":19,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":9},"n8n-nodes-base.stopAndError":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Mario","username":"octionic","bio":"Workflow Optimization Expert | Software Architect.

It periodically checks for new emails, reads their content, and categorizes them based on existing Gmail labels. If no matching label is found, the workflow creates a new label and assigns it to the email.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Polling for Emails**: The workflow triggers every 5 minutes to check for new emails using the Gmail Trigger node.\n- **Reading Labels**: Existing Gmail labels are fetched to determine the most relevant match for email categorization.\n- **Dynamic Labeling**: If no existing label matches, a new label is created dynamically based on the email's content.\n- **OpenAI Integration**: The workflow uses OpenAI's Chat model to analyze email content and suggest or create appropriate labels.\n- **Email Categorization**: Labels are applied to emails, ensuring they are organized in Gmail's structure. The workflow also removes less relevant emails (e.g., ads) from the inbox.\n\n## Nodes in Use\n1. **Gmail Trigger**: Polls Gmail every 5 minutes for new emails.\n2. **Gmail - Read Labels**: Fetches all existing Gmail labels.\n3. **Gmail - Get Message**: Retrieves the full content of a specific email.\n4. **Gmail - Add Label to Message**: Assigns a chosen label to the email.\n5. **Gmail - Create Label**: Creates a new label if necessary.\n6. **OpenAI Chat Model**: Analyzes email content for categorization.\n7. **Memory Buffer**: Retains context for email analysis across multiple iterations.\n8. **Wait Node**: Adds a buffer period to manage email processing.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- **Gmail API Setup**: Ensure Gmail OAuth2 credentials are configured in n8n.\n- **OpenAI API Key**: Configure OpenAI credentials for email analysis.\n- **Labeling Standards**: Maintain a consistent Gmail label structure for better organization.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Add your Gmail API credentials to the Gmail nodes.\n2. Add your OpenAI API credentials to the OpenAI Chat Model node.\n3. Activate the workflow. It will start polling for new emails every 5 minutes.\n4. Monitor and refine the categorization logic if necessary to ensure alignment with Gmail's organizational needs.\n\n## Use Case\nIdeal for individuals or teams handling high email volumes who want to maintain an organized inbox and automate repetitive categorization tasks.\n\nNote: You can improve the prompt to get better results from the agent by giving it more personal rules on how to categorize.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":13,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmailTool":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.gmailTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Martijn Kerver","username":"mkc","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/fe72c50f0c4d39bbfa48922c6996bdb1536d6dfefa73ec881562587bb49fae50?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2740,"template_name":"Basic Automatic Gmail Email Labelling with OpenAI and Gmail API","unique_visitors":1585,"unique_weekly_visitors":2,"unique_monthly_visitors":448,"unique_inserters":557,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":183},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2741","wf_detais":{"id":2741,"name":"AI-Powered RAG Workflow For Stock Earnings Report Analysis","createdAt":"2025-01-17T09:45:18.164Z","description":"This n8n workflow creates a financial analysis tool that generates reports on a company's quarterly earnings using the capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, Google's Gemini AI and Pinecone's vector search.

It automatically indexes new or updated documents in a Pinecone vector database, allowing the chatbot to provide accurate and up-to-date information. The workflow uses Google's Gemini AI for both embeddings and response generation.\n\n## How it works\nThe workflow uses two `Google Drive Trigger` nodes: one for detecting new files added to a specified Google Drive folder, and another for detecting file updates in that same folder.\n1. Automated Indexing: When a new or updated document is detected\n2. The `Google Drive` node downloads the file.\n3. The `Default Data Loader` node loads the document content.\n4. The `Recursive Character Text Splitter` node breaks the document into smaller text chunks.\n5. The Embeddings Google Gemini node generates embeddings for each text chunk using the text-embedding-004 model.\n6. The `Pinecone Vector Store` node indexes the text chunks and their embeddings in a specified Pinecone index.\n7.The Chat Trigger node receives user questions through a chat interface. The user's question is passed to an AI Agent node.\n8. The `AI Agent` node uses a `Vector Store Tool` node, linked to a Pinecone Vector Store node in query mode, to retrieve relevant text chunks from Pinecone based on the user's question.\n9. The AI Agent sends the retrieved information and the user's question to the Google Gemini Chat Model (gemini-pro).\n10. The `Google Gemini Chat Model` generates a comprehensive and informative answer based on the retrieved documents.\n11.

In this specific case, we will use a generic \"AI Agent\" node to illustrate that it could use other models from different data providers.\n\n### Enhanced Weather Forecasting\n\nIn this small example, it's easy to demonstrate how to obtain weather forecast results from the Open-Meteo site to accurately display the upcoming days.\n\nThis can be used to plan travel decisions, for example.\n\n## What this workflow does\n\n1. We will make an HTTP request to find out the geographic coordinates of a city.\n2. Then, we will make other HTTP requests to discover the weather for the upcoming days.\n\nIn this workshop, we demonstrate that the AI will be able to determine which tool to call first—it will first call the geolocation tool and then the weather forecast tool.

It streamlines the process of capturing leads, analyzing inquiries, and generating actionable responses. The workflow uses ERPNext to capture inquiries, analyzes them with AI, and notifies the appropriate team or individual, all while maintaining a professional approach.\n\n---\n\n### **What This Template Does**\n1. **ERPNext Webhook Integration:**\n   - Captures leads and inquiries through ERPNext webhooks.\n   - Triggers the workflow when a new lead is created.\n\n2. **AI-Powered Inquiry Analysis:**\n   - Uses AI to extract key details from lead notes (e.g., customer name, organization, inquiry summary).\n   - Classifies inquiries as valid or invalid based on relevance to products, services, or solutions.\n\n3. **Contact Assignment:**\n   - Matches inquiries to the appropriate contact(s) using a Google Sheets database or ERPNext contact information.\n   - Handles multiple contacts if required.\n\n4. **Email Notifications:**\n   - Generates professional email notifications for valid inquiries.\n   - Sends emails to the appropriate contact(s) with inquiry details and action steps.\n\n5. **Invalid Lead Handling:**\n   - Identifies invalid inquiries (e.g., unrelated to products or services) and flags them for follow-up or dismissal.\n\n6. **Custom Email Formatting:**\n   - Converts plain text into professionally formatted HTML emails.\n   - Ensures that communication is clear, concise, and visually appealing.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n\n#### **Step 1: Capture Lead Data**\n- **Webhook in ERPNext:**\n  - Create a webhook in ERPNext for the \"Lead\" DocType.\n  - Set the trigger to `on_insert` to capture new leads in real-time.\n\n- **Lead Details:**\n  - The workflow fetches lead details, including notes, contact information, and the source of the lead.\n\n#### **Step 2: Validate and Analyze Inquiry**\n- **AI Agent for Analysis:**\n  - An AI agent analyzes the lead notes to extract key details and classify the inquiry as valid or invalid.\n  - The analysis includes checking the relevance of the inquiry to products, services, or solutions offered by the company.\n\n- **Invalid Leads:**\n  - If the inquiry is invalid, the workflow flags it and stops further processing.\n\n#### **Step 3: Assign Contact(s)**\n- **Google Sheets Integration:**\n  - Uses a Google Sheets database to map products, services, or solutions to responsible contacts.\n  - Ensures that inquiries are directed to the right person or team.\n\n- **Multiple Contacts:**\n  - Handles cases where multiple contacts are responsible for a particular product or service.\n\n#### **Step 4: Generate and Send Email Notifications**\n- **AI-Generated Emails:**\n  - The workflow generates a professional email summarizing the inquiry.\n  - Emails include details like customer name, organization, inquiry summary, and action steps.\n\n- **Custom HTML Formatting:**\n  - Emails are converted to HTML for a polished and professional appearance.\n\n- **Send Notifications:**\n  - Sends email notifications through Microsoft Outlook or another configured email client.\n  - Optionally, notifies via WhatsApp or SMS for urgent inquiries.\n\n#### **Step 5: Post-Inquiry Actions**\n- **ERPNext Record Updates:**\n  - Updates the lead record in ERPNext with relevant details, including inquiry status and contact information.\n\n---\n\n### **Setup Instructions**\n\n#### **Prerequisites**\n1. **ERPNext:**\n   - A configured ERPNext instance with lead data and a webhook for the \"Lead\" DocType.\n2. **Google Sheets:**\n   - A sheet mapping products, services, or solutions to responsible contacts.\n3. **AI Integration:**\n   - Credentials for OpenAI or other supported AI platforms.\n4. **Email Client:**\n   - Credentials for Microsoft Outlook or another email client.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Setup**\n1. **ERPNext Configuration:**\n   - Create a webhook for the \"Lead\" DocType in ERPNext.\n   - Test the webhook with sample data to ensure proper integration.\n\n2. **Workflow Import:**\n   - Import the workflow template into n8n.\n   - Configure nodes with your API credentials for ERPNext, Google Sheets, and AI tools.\n\n3. **Google Sheets Integration:**\n   - Prepare a Google Sheet with columns for product, service, or solution and the responsible contact(s).\n   - Link the sheet to the workflow.\n\n4. **AI Agent Configuration:**\n   - Customize the AI agent’s prompts to align with your business’s products and services.\n   - Adjust criteria for valid and invalid inquiries as needed.\n\n5. **Email Setup:**\n   - Configure the email client node with your email service credentials.\n   - Customize the email template for your organization.\n\n6. **Testing:**\n   - Run the workflow with sample leads to validate the entire process.\n   - Check email notifications, contact assignments, and record updates in ERPNext.\n\n---\n\n### **Dos and Don’ts**\n\n#### **Dos:**\n- **Test Thoroughly:** Test the workflow with various scenarios before deploying in production.\n- **Secure Credentials:** Keep API and email credentials secure to avoid unauthorized access.\n- **Customize Prompts:** Tailor AI prompts to match your business needs and language style.\n- **Use Professional Email Templates:** Ensure emails are clear and well-formatted.\n\n#### **Don’ts:**\n- **Skip Validation:** Always validate inquiry data to avoid sending irrelevant notifications.\n- **Overload the Workflow:** Avoid adding unnecessary nodes that can slow down processing.\n- **Ignore Errors:** Monitor logs and address errors promptly for a smooth workflow.\n\n---\n\n### **Resources**\n- **YouTube Tutorial:**  \n  Watch the full step-by-step tutorial on setting up this workflow:  \n  [SyncBricks YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@syncbricks)\n\n- **Courses and Training:**  \n  Learn more about ERPNext and AI automation through my comprehensive courses:  \n  [SyncBricks LMS](http://lms.syncbricks.com)\n\n- **Support and Contact:**  \n  -

The workflow will periodically query both sources and use regular expressions and some JavaScript to edit several fields until we have the desired data in the proper format.\n- Once the sources are formatted, we will combine them using the \"Merge\" node.\n- Since the workflow will run twice a day, we will discard items older than two days. This will be achieved using a \"Filter\" node.\n- A \"Sort\" node will arrange the items by publication date so that the most recent ones appear first.\n- To create a flat list in \"Markdown\" format from the resulting items, we will use a small JavaScript function. This function must escape special characters to ensure they are correctly interpreted.\n- Finally, the list will be sent to the appropriate channel using a \"Telegram\" node.\n\n## Configuration Instructions:\n- When opening the workflow for the first time, configure the Telegram credential.\n- In the \"RSS\" nodes, insert the URLs of the sources to query.\n- In the \"Edit Fields\" nodes we will have to adjust the regular expressions to obtain the desired result based on our RSS sources. In this case the expressions have been adjusted to obtain the name, size and link of each published file.\n- In the \"Sort\" node we can modify the maximum age of the elements that we are going to send. In this case, 2 days have been included (2 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 milliseconds) since it is necessary to take into account that Telegram has a maximum message length and if we exceed it, it will return an error instead of sending it.\n- Lastly, include the channel ID in the \"Telegram\" node where the messages will be sent.\n\n\nTemplate was created in n8n v1.72.1","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":13,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.sort":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.rssFeedRead":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Sherlockes","username":"sherlockes","bio":"","verified":false,"links":["https://sherblog.es"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/feb9866e71611dc78851ffebfa0ca03c60df5c9f6b718a2e9e735d69a5a8f8c2?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2748,"template_name":"Merge and filter several Rss & send to Telegram","unique_visitors":946,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":307,"unique_inserters":326,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":105},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2764","wf_detais":{"id":2764,"name":"Extract and process information directly from PDF using Claude and Gemini","createdAt":"2025-01-21T07:44:36.708Z","description":"## Overview\n- This workflow helps you compare Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Flash when extracting data from a PDF\n- This workflow extracts and processes the data within a PDF in **one single step**, **instead of calling an OCR and then an LLM”**\n\n\n## How it works\n- The initial 2 steps download the PDF and convert it to base64.\n- This base64 string is then sent to both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Flash to extract information.\n- This workflow is made to let you compare results, latency, and cost (in their dedicated dashboard).\n\n\n## How to use it\n- Set up your Google Drive if not already done\n- Select a document on your Google Drive\n- Modify the prompt in \"Define Prompt\" to extract the information you need and transform it as wanted.\n- Get a [Claude API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) and/or [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)\n- Note that you can deactivate one of the 2 API calls if you don't want to try both\n- Test the Workflow\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":11,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Agent Studio","username":"agentstudio","bio":"We are a product studio that helps organizations leverage no-code and generative AI to automate internal processes and launch new digital products.","verified":true,"links":["https://agentstudio.io/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e9cf0d0fccead46655b11b2ce215cf14d33ecdaa2ce52828f003574c1800e77a?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2764,"template_name":"Extract and process information directly from PDF using Claude and Gemini","unique_visitors":2078,"unique_weekly_visitors":3,"unique_monthly_visitors":895,"unique_inserters":521,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":222},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2765","wf_detais":{"id":2765,"name":"Automated Hugging Face Paper Summary Fetching & Categorization Workflow","createdAt":"2025-01-21T09:33:22.365Z","description":"# **How the Automated Workflow Works**  \n## **Scheduled Fetching from Hugging Face** ⏰  \nThe workflow triggers every weekday at 8 AM, automatically fetching the latest papers from **Hugging Face** for easy access.  \n\n## **Duplication Check to Avoid Redundant Entries** 🔍  \nIt ensures the paper's summary is not already stored in your **Notion** workspace, preventing duplicate records and keeping your database organized.  \n\n## **Content Analysis with OpenAI** 🧠  \nUsing **OpenAI**'s powerful capabilities, the workflow analyzes the fetched paper summary, extracts key insights, and categorizes the content for easier understanding.  \n\n## **Data Storage and Notification Integration** 📥🔔  \nOnce the summary is processed, it's automatically stored in your **Notion** workspace, and a notification containing the paper details is sent to your designated **Slack** channel for quick reference.\n\n---\n\n# **Set Up Your Automated Workflow**  \n## **Create Your n8n Account** 📝  \nStart by registering for an **n8n** account and logging into the [**n8n cloud service**](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/j7p1m1a0ln1d).  \n\n## **Connect OpenAI, Notion, and Slack** 🔗  \nLink your **OpenAI**, **Notion**, and **Slack** accounts by entering the appropriate tokens.

This seriously cuts down on maintainance requirements and is reusable for any number of tables at little cost.\n\n**Check out the video demo I did for n8n Studio here**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fNAD1u8BZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fNAD1u8BZw)\n\n**Check out the example Airtable here:** [https://airtable.com/appAyH3GCBJ56cfXl/shrXzR1Tj99kuQbyL](https://airtable.com/appAyH3GCBJ56cfXl/shrXzR1Tj99kuQbyL)\n\n**Looking for the Baserow Version?** [https://n8n.io/workflows/2780-ai-data-extraction-with-dynamic-prompts-and-baserow/](https://n8n.io/workflows/2780-ai-data-extraction-with-dynamic-prompts-and-baserow/)\n\n## How it works\n* Given we have an \"input\" field for context and a number of fields for the data we want to extract, this template will run in the background to react to any changes to either the \"input\" or fields and automatically update the rows accordingly.\n* The key is that Airtable fields have a special property called the \"field description\". In this pattern, we use this property to allow the user to store a simple prompt describing the data that should exist in the column.\n* Our n8n template reads these column descriptions aka \"prompts\" to use as instructions to perform tasks on the \"input\".\n* In this template, the \"input\" is a PDF of a resume/CV and the columns are attributes a HR person would want to extract from it - such as full name, address, last position, years of experience etc.\n\n## How to use\n* First publish this template and ensure it's accessible via webhook URL.\n* You then have to run the \"create airtable webhooks\" mini-flow to configure your Airtable to send change events to the n8n template. This mini-flow exists in the template but you'll have to update the IDs.\n\nCheck the template for more instructions.\n\n## Requirements\n* Airtable for Tables/Database\n* OpenAI for LLM and extraction. Feel free to choose another LLM if preferred.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* If you're not using files, you can replace the \"input\" field with anything you like. For example, the \"input\" could be single line text.\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":51,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.airtable":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":15},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Jimleuk","username":"jimleuk","bio":"Freelance consultant based in the UK specialising in AI-powered automations.

Using the ID of the task, the trigger is being locked down for 15 seconds.\n- Depending on the detected changes, the other side is updated accordingly.\nGenerally Notion is treaded as the main source. Using an \"Obsolete\" Status, it is guaranteed, that tasks never get deleted entirely by accident.\n- The Todoist ID is stored in the Notion task, so they stay linked together\n- An additional full sync workflow daily fixes inconsistencies, if any of them occurred, since webhooks cannot be trusted entirely.\n- Since Todoist requires a more complex setup, a tiny workflow helps with activating the webhook.\n- Another tiny workflow helps generating a global config, which is used by all workflows for mapping purposes.\n\n## Mapping (Notion &gt;&gt; Todoist)\n\n- Name: Task Name\n- Priority: Priority (1: do first, 2: urgent, 3: important, 4: unset)\n- Due: Date\n- Status: Section (Done: completed, Obsolete: deleted)\n- &lt;page_link&gt;: Description (read-only)\n- Todoist ID: &lt;task_id&gt;\n\n## Current limitations\n\n- Changes on the same task cannot be made simultaneously in both systems within a 15-20 second time frame\n- Subtasks are not linked automatically to their parent yet\n- Recurring tasks are not supported yet\n- Tasks names do not support URL’s yet\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Notion\n- A database must already exist (get a basic template [here](https://steadfast-banjo-d1f.notion.site/17682b476c848086b002de766879aa71)) with the following properties (case matters!):\n  - Text: \"Name\"\n  - Status: \"Status\", containing at least the options \"Backlog\", \"In progress\", \"Done\", \"Obsolete\"\n  - Select: \"Priority\", containing the options \"do first\", \"urgent\", \"important\"\n  - Date: \"Due\"\n  - Checkbox: \"Focus\"\n  - Text: \"Todoist ID\"\n### Todoist\n- A project must already exist with the same sections like defined as Status in Notion (except Done and Obsolete)\n### Redis\n- Create a [Free Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/try-free/) instance or self-host\n\n\n## Setup\n\n[![setup video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/73jhyU0t4c4/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/73jhyU0t4c4)\n\n*The setup involves quite a lot of steps, yet many of them can be automated for business internal purposes.*\n\nJust follow the video or do the following steps:\n- Setup credentials for Notion (access token), Todoist (access token) and Redis - you can also create empty credentials and populate these later during further setup\n- Clone this workflow by clicking the \"Use workflow\" button and then choosing your n8n instance - otherwise you need to map the credentials of many nodes.\n- Follow the instructions described within the bundle of sticky notes on the top left of the workflow\n\n\n## How to use\n\n- You can apply changes (create, update, delete) to tasks both in Notion and Todoist which then get synced over within a couple of seconds (this is handled by the differential realtime sync)\n- The daily running full sync, resolves possible discrepancies in Todoist and sends a summary via email, if anything needed to be updated. In case that contains an unintended change, you can jump to the Task from the email directly to fix it manually.","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":15,"name":"Design"},{"id":17,"name":"HR"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":246,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":18},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":22},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":17},"n8n-nodes-base.form":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.html":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.redis":{"count":11},"n8n-nodes-base.crypto":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":17},"n8n-nodes-base.notion":{"count":15},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.todoist":{"count":12},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":72},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":12},"n8n-nodes-base.stopAndError":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.executionData":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.compareDatasets":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Mario","username":"octionic","bio":"Workflow Optimization Expert | Software Architect.

This seriously cuts down on maintainance requirements and is reusable for any number of tables at little cost.\n\n**Check out the n8n Studio Episode here**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fNAD1u8BZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fNAD1u8BZw)\n\n**Community post here**: [https://community.n8n.io/t/dynamic-prompts-with-n8n-baserow-and-airtable/72052](https://community.n8n.io/t/dynamic-prompts-with-n8n-baserow-and-airtable/72052)\n\n\n**Looking for the Airtable Version?** [https://n8n.io/workflows/2771-ai-data-extraction-with-dynamic-prompts-and-airtable/](https://n8n.io/workflows/2771-ai-data-extraction-with-dynamic-prompts-and-airtable/)\n\n\n## How it works\n* Given we have an \"input\" field for context and a number of fields for the data we want to extract, this template will run in the background to react to any changes to either the \"input\" or fields and automatically update the rows accordingly.\n* The key is that Baserow fields have a special property called the \"field description\". In this pattern, we use this property to allow the user to store a simple prompt describing the data that should exist in the column.\n* Our n8n template reads these column descriptions aka \"prompts\" to use as instructions to perform tasks on the \"input\".\n* In this template, the \"input\" is a PDF of a resume/CV and the columns are attributes a HR person would want to extract from it - such as full name, address, last position, years of experience etc.\n\n## How to use\n* First publish this template and ensure it's accessible via webhook URL.\n* You then have to complete the \"create Baserow webhooks\" steps to configure your baserow to send change events to the n8n template. Baserow webhooks are created in the Baserow web interface.\n\nCheck the template for more instructions.\n\n## Requirements\n* Baserow for Tables/Database\n* OpenAI for LLM and extraction. Feel free to choose another LLM if preferred.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* If you're not using files, you can replace the \"input\" field with anything you like. For example, the \"input\" could be single line text.\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":45,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":15},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Jimleuk","username":"jimleuk","bio":"Freelance consultant based in the UK specialising in AI-powered automations.

It handles two scenarios:  \n1. **Product Search**: Extracts user intent (keywords, price ranges, SKUs) and fetches matching products from WooCommerce.  \n2. **General Inquiries**: Answers store-related questions (e.g., opening hours, policies) using RAG and documents stored in Google Drive.  \n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**  \n\n#### **1. Chat Interaction & Intent Detection**  \n- **Chat Trigger**:  \n  - Starts when a user sends a message (*\"When chat message received\"*).  \n- **Information Extractor**:  \n  - Uses OpenAI to analyze the message and determine if the user is **searching for a product** or asking a **general question**.  \n  - Extracts:  \n    - `search` (true/false).  \n    - `keyword`, `priceRange`, `SKU`, `category` (if product-related).  \n  - Example:  \n    ```json  \n    {  \n      \"search\": true,  \n      \"keyword\": \"red handbags\",  \n      \"priceRange\": { \"min\": 50, \"max\": 100 },  \n      \"SKU\": \"BAG123\",  \n      \"category\": \"women's accessories\"  \n    }  \n    ```  \n\n#### **2. Product Search (WooCommerce Integration)**  \n- **AI Agent**:  \n  - If `search: true`, routes the request to the `personal_shopper` tool.  \n  - **WooCommerce Node**:  \n    - Queries the WooCommerce store using extracted parameters (`keyword`, `priceRange`, `SKU`).  \n    - Filters products in stock (`stockStatus: \"instock\"`).  \n    - Returns matching products (e.g., \"red handbags under €100\").  \n\n#### **3. General Inquiries (RAG System)**  \n- **RAG Tool**:  \n  - If `search: false`, uses the **Qdrant Vector Store** to retrieve store information from documents.  \n  - **Google Drive Integration**:  \n    - Documents (e.g., store policies, FAQs) are stored in Google Drive.  \n    - Downloaded, split into chunks, and embedded into Qdrant for semantic search.  \n  - **OpenAI Chat Model**: Generates answers based on retrieved documents (e.g., \"Our store opens at 9 AM\").  \n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n\n#### **1. Configure the RAG System**  \n- **Google Drive Setup**:  \n  - Upload store documents .  \n  - Update the **Google Drive2** node with your folder ID.  \n- **Qdrant Vector Database**:  \n  - Clean the collection (update **Qdrant Vector Store** node with your URL).  \n  - Use **Embeddings OpenAI** to convert documents into vectors.  \n\n#### **2. Configure OpenAI & WooCommerce**  \n- **OpenAI Credentials**:  \n  - Add your API key to all OpenAI nodes (`OpenAI Chat Model`, `Embeddings OpenAI`, etc.).  \n- **WooCommerce Integration**:  \n  - Connect your WooCommerce store (credentials in the `personal_shopper` node).  \n  - Ensure product data is synced and accessible.  \n\n#### **3. Customize the AI Agent**  \n- **Intent Detection**:  \n  - Modify the **Information Extractor**’s system prompt to align with your store’s terminology.  \n- **RAG Responses**:  \n  - Update the tool description to reflect your store’s documents.  \n\n---\n\n### **Notes**  \nThis template is ideal for e-commerce businesses needing a hybrid assistant for product discovery and customer support.","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":25,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wooCommerceTool":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":3},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolCalculator":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolVectorStore":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStoreQdrant":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.informationExtractor":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterTokenSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Davide","username":"n3witalia","bio":"Full-stack Web Developer based in Italy specialising in Marketing & AI-powered automations.

Here's a breakdown of the workflow:\n\n**Notion - Page Added Trigger:** The automation starts by monitoring for newly added pages in a specific Notion database. It triggers whenever a new page is created, capturing the page's metadata.\n\n**Notion - Retrieve Page Content:** Once triggered, the automation fetches the full content of the newly added Notion page, including blocks like text, images, and videos.\n\n**Filter Non-Text Content:** The next step filters out non-text content (such as images and videos), ensuring only textual content is processed.\n\n**Summarize - Concatenate Notion's blocks content:** The remaining text content is concatenated into a single block of text for easier processing.\n\n**Token Splitter:** The concatenated text is then split into manageable tokens, which are chunks of text that can be used for embedding.\n\n**Create metadata and load content:** Metadata such as the page ID, creation time, and title are added to the content, making it easy to reference and track.\n\n**Embeddings Google Gemini:** The processed text is passed through a Google Gemini model to generate embeddings, which are numerical representations of the text that capture its semantic meaning.\n\n**Pinecone Vector Store:** Finally, the embeddings, along with the content and metadata, are stored in a Pinecone vector store, making it searchable and ready for use in applications like document retrieval or natural language processing tasks.\n\nThis workflow ensures that every new page added to the Notion database is processed into a format that can be easily searched and used in machine learning applications. The automation runs every minute to capture new data in real-time, providing an up-to-date and searchable vector database of Notion content.\n\n**Use Case:**\n\nThis automation converts Notion pages into vector embeddings and stores them in Pinecone for enhanced search and AI-driven insights. It’s ideal for teams using Notion for knowledge management, enabling semantic search and context-based content retrieval. For example, employees can easily find relevant information across documents, and data scientists can use AI models to analyze and summarize the content stored in Notion.","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.notion":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.summarize":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.notionTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStorePinecone":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsGoogleGemini":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterTokenSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Udit Rawat","username":"ailistmaster","bio":"Hi, I’m Udit, an Acquia-certified developer with a strong background in web development and creating enterprise solutions.

Below is a detailed analysis of what each node in the workflow does:\n\n---\n### **How It Works**\n1. **Triggering the Workflow**:\n   - The workflow starts with a **Manual Trigger** node, which is activated when the user clicks \"Test workflow\" in the n8n interface.\n\n2. **Fetching Data**:\n   - The **Get Ideas** node retrieves data from a Google Sheets document. It reads a specific sheet and filters the data based on the \"ID POST\" column, returning the first matching row.\n\n3. **Setting the Prompt**:\n   - The **Set your prompt** node extracts the `PROMPT` field from the Google Sheets data and assigns it to a variable for use in subsequent steps.\n\n4. **Generating Content**:\n   - The **Generate article** node uses an AI model (DeepSeek) to create an SEO-friendly article based on the prompt. The article includes an introduction, 2-3 chapters, and a conclusion, formatted in HTML.\n   - The **Generate title** node uses the same AI model to generate a concise, SEO-optimized title for the article.\n\n5. **Publishing on WordPress**:\n   - The **Create post on WordPress** node creates a new draft post on WordPress using the generated title and article content.\n\n6. **Generating and Uploading an Image**:\n   - The **Generate Image** node creates a photorealistic image based on the article title using an AI model (OpenAI).\n   - The **Upload image** node uploads the generated image to WordPress as a media file.\n   - The **Set Image** node assigns the uploaded image as the featured image for the WordPress post.\n\n7. **Updating Google Sheets**:\n   - The **Update Sheet** node updates the original Google Sheets document with the post details, including the title, post ID, creation date, and row number.\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n1. **Configure Google Sheets Integration**:\n   - Set up the **Google Sheets** node to connect to your Google account and specify the document ID and sheet name to read from and update.\n\n2. **Set Up AI Models**:\n   - Configure the **OpenAI** nodes (for generating the article, title, and image) with the appropriate API credentials and model settings (e.g., `deepseek-reasoner` for text generation).\n\n3. **Configure WordPress Integration**:\n   - Set up the **WordPress** node with your WordPress site's API credentials to allow creating posts and uploading media.\n\n4. **Define the Prompt and Content Structure**:\n   - In the **Set your prompt** node, ensure the `prompt` variable is correctly mapped to the data from Google Sheets.\n   - In the **Generate article** and **Generate title** nodes, define the instructions for the AI model to generate the desired content.\n\n5. **Set Up Image Generation**:\n   - Configure the **Generate Image** node with the appropriate prompt and image settings (e.g., size, quality, style).\n\n6. **Configure HTTP Requests for Media Upload**:\n   - Set up the **Upload image** and **Set Image** nodes to use the WordPress REST API for uploading and assigning the featured image.\n\n7. **Map Data for Google Sheets Update**:\n   - In the **Update Sheet** node, map the relevant fields (e.g., title, post ID, date) to the appropriate columns in the Google Sheets document.\n\n8. **Test and Activate the Workflow**:\n   - Run the workflow manually to ensure all steps execute correctly.\n   - Once verified, activate the workflow for automated execution.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall purpose of the workflow**\nThis workflow automates the creation of SEO-friendly content for a WordPress blog. Starting from a prompt extracted from a Google Sheets document, it generates an article, a title, and an image, publishes the post on WordPress, and updates the Google Sheets document with the details of the created post.

It leverages AI to ensure accurate and professional communication.\n\n### **How It Works**\n1. **Email Trigger**:\n   - The workflow starts with the **Email Trigger (IMAP)** node, which monitors an email inbox for new messages. When a new email arrives, it triggers the workflow.\n\n2. **Email Preprocessing**:\n   - The **Markdown** node converts the email's HTML content into plain text for easier processing by the AI models.\n\n3. **Email Summarization**:\n   - The **Email Summarization Chain** node uses an AI model (DeepSeek R1) to generate a concise summary of the email. The summary is limited to 100 words and is written in Italian.\n\n4. **Email Classification**:\n   - The **Email Classifier** node categorizes the email into predefined categories (e.g., \"Company info request\"). If the email does not fit any category, it is classified as \"other\".\n\n5. **Email Response Generation**:\n   - The **Write email** node uses an AI model (OpenAI) to draft a professional response to the email. The response is based on the email content and is limited to 100 words.\n   - The **Review email** node uses another AI model (DeepSeek) to review and format the drafted response. It ensures the response is professional and formatted in HTML (e.g., using `<br>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<p>` tags where necessary).\n\n6. **Email Sending**:\n   - The **Send Email** node sends the reviewed and formatted response back to the original sender.\n\n7. **Vector Database Integration**:\n   - The **Qdrant Vector Store** node retrieves relevant information from a vector database (Qdrant) to assist in generating accurate responses. This is particularly useful for emails classified as \"Company info request\".\n   - The **Embeddings OpenAI** node generates embeddings for the email content, which are used to query the vector database.\n\n8. **Document Vectorization**:\n   - The workflow includes steps to create and refresh a Qdrant collection (**Create collection** and **Refresh collection** nodes).\n   - Documents from Google Drive are downloaded (**Get folder** and **Download Files** nodes), processed into embeddings (**Embeddings OpenAI1** node), and stored in the Qdrant vector store (**Qdrant Vector Store1** node).\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n1. **Configure Email Trigger**:\n   - Set up the **Email Trigger (IMAP)** node with the appropriate IMAP credentials to monitor the email inbox.\n\n2. **Set Up AI Models**:\n   - Configure the **DeepSeek R1**, **OpenAI**, and **DeepSeek** nodes with the appropriate API credentials for text summarization, response generation, and review.\n\n3. **Set Up Email Classification**:\n   - Define the categories in the **Email Classifier** node (e.g., \"Company info request\", \"Other\").\n   - Ensure the **OpenAI 4-o-mini** node is configured to assist in classification.\n\n4. **Set Up Vector Database**:\n   - Configure the **Qdrant Vector Store** and **Qdrant Vector Store1** nodes with the appropriate Qdrant API credentials and collection details.\n   - Set up the **Embeddings OpenAI** and **Embeddings OpenAI1** nodes to generate embeddings for the email content and documents.\n\n5. **Set Up Document Processing**:\n   - Configure the **Get folder** and **Download Files** nodes to access and download documents from Google Drive.\n   - Use the **Token Splitter** and **Default Data Loader** nodes to process and split the documents into manageable chunks for vectorization.\n\n6. **Set Up Email Sending**:\n   - Configure the **Send Email** node with the appropriate SMTP credentials to send responses.\n\n7. **Test the Workflow**:\n   - Trigger the workflow manually using the **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node to ensure all steps execute correctly.\n   - Verify that emails are summarized, classified, and responded to accurately.\n\n8. **Activate the Workflow**:\n   - Once tested, activate the workflow to automate the process of handling incoming emails.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Features**\n- **Automated Email Handling**: Automatically processes incoming emails, summarizes them, and generates professional responses.\n- **AI-Powered Classification**: Uses AI to classify emails into relevant categories for targeted responses.\n- **Vector Database Integration**: Retrieves relevant information from a vector database to enhance response accuracy.\n- **Document Vectorization**: Processes and stores documents from Google Drive in a vector database for quick retrieval.\n- **Professional Email Formatting**: Ensures responses are professionally formatted and concise.\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":26,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.markdown":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.emailSend":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.emailReadImap":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":4},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textClassifier":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStoreQdrant":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainSummarization":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterTokenSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Davide","username":"n3witalia","bio":"Full-stack Web Developer based in Italy specialising in Marketing & AI-powered automations.

This requires the external system to pass through some context information (`resumeUrl`), but allows the \"primary\" workflow execution to continue with **BOTH** its own (previous-node) context, **AND** the input received in the \"secondary\" trigger/process.\n\n### Primary Workflow Trigger/Execution\nThe workflow path from the `primary trigger` initiates some external, independent process and provides \"context\" which includes the value of `$execution.resumeUrl`. This execution then reaches a `Wait` node configured with `Resume - On Webhook Call`  and stops until a call to `resumeUrl` is received.\n\n### External, Independent Process\nThe external, independent process could be anything like a Telegram conversation, or a web-service as long as:\n1. it results in a single execution of the `Secondary Workflow Trigger`, and\n2. it can pass through the value of `resumeUrl` associated with the `Primary Workflow Execution`\n\n### Secondary Workflow Trigger/Execution\nThe `secondary workflow execution` can start with any kind of trigger as long as part of the input can include the `resumeUrl`.  To combine / rejoin the `primary workflow execution`, this execution passes along whatever it receives from its trigger input to the resume-webhook endpoint on the `Wait` node.\n\n## Notes\n* **IMPORTANT**: The workflow ids in the `Set` nodes marked **Update Me** have embedded references to the workflow IDs in the original system.  **They will need to be CHANGED to make this demo work.**\n* Note: The `Resume Other Workflow Execution` node in the template uses the `$env.WEBHOOK_URL` configuration to convert to an internal \"localhost\" call in a Docker environment.  This can be done differently.\n* **ALERT:** This pattern is NOT suitable for a workflow that handles multiple items because the first workflow execution will only be waiting for one callback.\n* The second workflow (not the second trigger in the first workflow) is just to demonstrate how the `Independent, External Process` needs to work.\n","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":23,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":10},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Hubschrauber","username":"hubschrauber","bio":"Software developer specializing in \"back-end plumbing\" to connect and sync data between large corporate systems, enabling application distribution/migration, scaling, and containerization.

Here’s how it operates:\n\n1. **Data Collection and Extraction**: \n   - The workflow begins with a form submission (`On form submission` node), which triggers the extraction of data from the uploaded CV file using the `Extract from File` node.\n   - Two `informationExtractor` nodes (`Qualifications` and `Personal Data`) are used to parse specific details such as educational background, work history, skills, city, birthdate, and telephone number from the text content of the CV.\n\n2. **Processing and Evaluation**:\n   - A `Merge` node combines the extracted personal and qualification data into a single output.\n   - This merged data is then passed through a `Summarization Chain` that generates a concise summary of the candidate’s profile.\n   - An `HR Expert` chain evaluates the candidate against a desired profile (`Profile Wanted`), assigning a score and providing considerations for hiring.\n   - Finally, all collected and processed data including the evaluation results are appended to a Google Sheets document via the `Google Sheets` node for further review or reporting purposes [[9]].\n\n### Set Up Steps\n\nTo replicate this workflow within your own n8n environment, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Configuration**:\n   - Begin by setting up an n8n instance if you haven't already; you can sign up directly on their website or self-host the application.\n   - Import the provided JSON configuration into your n8n workspace. Ensure that all necessary credentials (e.g., Google Drive, Google Sheets, OpenAI API keys) are correctly configured under the Credentials section since some nodes require external service integrations like Google APIs and OpenAI for language processing tasks.\n\n2. **Customization**:\n   - Adjust the parameters of each node according to your specific requirements. For example, modify the fields in the `formTrigger` node to match what kind of information you wish to collect from applicants.\n   - Customize the prompts given to AI models in nodes like `Qualifications`, `Summarization Chain`, and `HR Expert` so they align with the type of analyses you want performed on the candidates' profiles.\n   - Update the destination settings in the `Google Sheets` node to point towards your own spreadsheet where you would like the final outputs recorded.\n","categories":[{"id":17,"name":"HR"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":18,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainSummarization":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.informationExtractor":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserStructured":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Davide","username":"n3witalia","bio":"Full-stack Web Developer based in Italy specialising in Marketing & AI-powered automations.

It is useful for anyone who wants to stay updated on popular open-source projects without manually browsing GitHub’s trending page.\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving?\nManually checking GitHub’s trending repositories daily can be time-consuming and inefficient. This workflow automates the extraction of trending repositories, providing structured data including repository name, author, description, programming language, and direct repository links. \n\n## What this workflow does\nThis workflow scrapes the trending repositories from GitHub’s trending page and extracts essential metadata such as repository names, languages, descriptions, and URLs. It processes the extracted data and structures it into an easy-to-use format.\n\n## Setup\n1. Ensure you have n8n installed and configured.\n2. Import this workflow into your n8n instance.\n3. Run the workflow manually or schedule it to execute at regular intervals.\n4. (Optional) Customize the extracted data or integrate it with other systems.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n- Modify the HTTP request node to target different GitHub trending categories (e.g., specific programming languages).\n- Add further processing steps such as filtering repositories by stars, forks, or specific keywords.\n- Integrate this workflow with Slack, email, or a database to store or notify about trending repositories.\n\n## Workflow Steps\n1. **Trigger execution manually** using the **\"When clicking ‘Test workflow’\"** node.\n2. **Send an HTTP request** to fetch GitHub’s trending page using **\"Request to Github Trend\"**.\n3. **Extract the trending repositories box** from the HTML response using **\"Extract Box\"**.\n4. **Extract all repository data** including names, authors, descriptions, and languages using **\"Extract all repositories\"**.\n5. **Convert extracted data into a structured list** for easier processing using **\"Turn to a list\"**.\n6. **Extract detailed repository information** using **\"Extract repository data\"**.\n7. **Format and set variables** to ensure clean and structured data output using **\"Set Result Variables\"**.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Since GitHub’s trending page updates dynamically, ensure you run this workflow periodically to capture the latest trends.\n","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.html":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Teddy","username":"teddysbeach","bio":"12 years in development, South Korea, Seoul","verified":true,"links":["https://popol.me"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/b771a9567b1ac39d9b55f8ad7983bbcf2ebdc28919060dda15c13cf4dac9827a?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2866,"template_name":"Scrape Latest Github Trending Repositories","unique_visitors":889,"unique_weekly_visitors":2,"unique_monthly_visitors":456,"unique_inserters":416,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":200},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2868","wf_detais":{"id":2868,"name":"Backup your workflows to GitHub -- in (subfolders)","createdAt":"2025-02-08T21:34:44.233Z","description":"Based on [Jonathan](https://n8n.io/creators/jon-n8n) & [Solomon](https://n8n.io/creators/solomon) work.\n\n&gt; The only addition I've made is a Set node.

This workflow introduces a technique using PostBin, which provides a temporary, publicly accessible URL to receive webhook requests.  \n\n1. Generates a temporary webhook endpoint via PostBin.  \n2. Uses this endpoint in place of `localhost` to test webhooks.  \n3. Captures and displays the incoming webhook request data.  \n4. Enables debugging and iterating without modifying the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable.  \n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n- **Estimated time:** ~5–10 minutes  \n1. **Create a PostBin instance** to generate a publicly accessible webhook URL.  \n2. **Copy the PostBin URL** and use it as the webhook destination in n8n.  \n3. **Trigger the webhook** from an external service or manually.  \n4. **Inspect the request payload** in PostBin to verify data reception.  \n\n---  \n\n## **(EXAMPLE) Using PostBin for Webhook Testing in a BambooHR Integration**  \n\n### **How it Works**  \nIn this example, we apply the PostBin technique to a BambooHR integration. Instead of manually configuring a webhook in BambooHR, this workflow automates webhook registration using the BambooHR API. The workflow:  \n\n1. Uses the BambooHR API to programmatically register the PostBin URL as a webhook.  \n2. Retrieves the most recent webhook calls made by BambooHR to the PostBin URL.  \n3. (Optional) Sends a personalized Slack message for new employees using OpenAI.  \n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n- **Estimated time:** ~15–20 minutes  \n1. **Set up PostBin** using the steps from the first section.  \n2. **Log into BambooHR** to generate an API key for authentication.  \n3. **Run the workflow** to register the PostBin URL as a webhook in BambooHR via the API.\n4. **Retrieve recent webhook calls** from PostBin to validate data reception.  \n5.

It eliminates manual updates, enforces required variable checks, and ensures that AI interactions always receive **fully processed** prompts.\n\n---\n\n## **🚀 What Problem Does This Solve?**\n\nManually managing AI prompts can be inefficient and error-prone. This workflow:  \n✅ **Fetches dynamic prompts from GitHub**  \n✅ **Auto-populates placeholders with values from the `setVars` node**  \n✅ **Ensures all required variables are present before execution**  \n✅ **Processes the formatted prompt through an AI agent**\n\n---\n\n## **🛠 How This Workflow Works**\n\nThis workflow consists of **three key branches**, ensuring smooth prompt retrieval, variable validation, and AI processing.\n\n---\n\n### **1️⃣ Retrieve the Prompt from GitHub (HTTP Request → Extract from File → SetPrompt)**\n\n- The workflow starts manually or via an external trigger.\n- It **fetches a text-based prompt** stored in a GitHub repository.\n- The **Extract from File Node** retrieves the content from the GitHub file.\n- The **SetPrompt Node** stores the prompt, making it accessible for processing.\n\n📌 **Note:**  \nThe prompt must contain **n8n expression format variables** (e.g., `{{ $json.company }}`) so they can be dynamically replaced.\n\n---\n\n### **2️⃣ Extract & Auto-Populate Variables (Check All Prompt Vars → Replace Variables)**\n\n- A **Code Node scans the prompt** for placeholders in the **n8n expression format** (`{{ $json.variableName }}`).\n- The workflow **compares required variables** against the `setVars` node:\n    - ✅ **If all variables are present**, it proceeds to variable replacement.\n    - ❌ **If any variables are missing**, the workflow stops and returns an error listing them.\n- The **Replace Variables Node** replaces all placeholders with values from `setVars`.\n\n📌 **Example of a properly formatted GitHub prompt:**\n\n```\nHello {{ $json.company }}, your product {{ $json.features }} launches on {{ $json.launch_date }}.\n```\n\nThis ensures **seamless replacement when processed in n8n**.\n\n---\n\n### **3️⃣ AI Processing & Output (AI Agent → Prompt Output)**\n\n- The **Set Completed Prompt Node** stores the final, processed prompt.\n- The **AI Agent Node** (Ollama Chat Model) processes the prompt.\n- The **Prompt Output Node** returns the **fully formatted response**.\n\n📌 **Optional:** Modify this to use OpenAI, Claude, or other AI models.\n\n---\n\n## **⚠️ Error Handling: Missing Variables**\n\nIf a required variable is missing, the workflow **stops execution** and provides an error message:\n\n```\n⚠️ Missing Required Variables: [\"launch_date\"]\n```\n\nThis ensures **no incomplete prompts are sent to AI agents**.\n\n---\n\n## **✅ Example Use Case**\n\n### **📜 GitHub Prompt File (Using n8n Expressions)**\n\n```\nHello {{ $json.company }}, your product {{ $json.features }} launches on {{ $json.launch_date }}.\n```\n\n### **🔹 Variables in `setVars` Node**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"company\": \"PropTechPro\",\n  \"features\": \"AI-powered Property Management\",\n  \"launch_date\": \"March 15, 2025\"\n}\n```\n\n### **✅ Successful Output**\n\n```\nHello PropTechPro, your product AI-powered Property Management launches on March 15, 2025.\n```\n\n### **🚨 Error Output (If Missing `launch_date`)**\n\n```\n⚠️ Missing Required Variables: [\"launch_date\"]\n```\n\n---\n\n## **🔧 Setup Instructions**\n\n### **1️⃣ Connect Your GitHub Repository**\n\n- Store your prompt in a **public or private GitHub repo**.\n- The workflow will fetch the raw file using the **GitHub API**.\n\n### **2️⃣ Configure the SetVars Node**\n\n- Define the required variables in the **SetVars Node**.\n- Make sure the variable names **match those used in the prompt**.\n\n### **3️⃣ Test & Run**\n\n- Click **Test Workflow** to execute.\n- If variables are missing, it will show an error.\n- If everything is correct, it will output the **fully formatted prompt**.\n\n---\n\n## **⚡ How to Customize This Workflow**\n\n💡 **Need CRM or Database Integration?**\n\n- Connect the `setVars` node to an **Airtable, Google Sheets, or HubSpot API** to pull variables dynamically.\n\n💡 **Want to Modify the AI Model?**\n\n- Replace the **Ollama Chat Model** with OpenAI, Claude, or a custom LLM endpoint.\n\n---\n\n## **📌 Why Use This Workflow?**\n\n✅ **No Manual Updates Required** – Fetches prompts dynamically from GitHub.  \n✅ **Prevents Broken Prompts** – Ensures required variables exist before execution.  \n✅ **Works for Any Use Case** – Handles AI chat prompts, marketing messages, and chatbot scripts.  \n✅ **Compatible with All n8n Deployments** – Works on **Cloud, Self-Hosted, and Desktop versions**.","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":17,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.github":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.stopAndError":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOllama":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"RealSimple Solutions","username":"joeperes","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["https://joeperes.com"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/4ad55fbdcc7808056aa180c02d52e3e373d4b894df7fa986e2dfd6c7eb127bfc?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2893,"template_name":"Fetch Dynamic Prompts from GitHub and Auto-Populate n8n Expressions in Prompt","unique_visitors":737,"unique_weekly_visitors":1,"unique_monthly_visitors":290,"unique_inserters":96,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":47},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2898","wf_detais":{"id":2898,"name":"AI Agent: Find the Right LinkedIn Profiles in Seconds","createdAt":"2025-02-13T14:50:33.590Z","description":"# Automate LinkedIn Prospecting with AI Agent and Get Results Straight to Google Sheets!\n\nA practical AI-powered workflow that helps you find relevant LinkedIn profiles using natural language queries and saves the results automatically to Google Sheets.\n\n## 🎯 What It Actually Does\n\n- Accepts natural language requests (e.g., \"Find marketing managers in Paris\")\n- Uses AI to extract search parameters:\n  -

Here's how it operates:\n\n1. **Webhook Trigger**:\n   - The workflow starts with a `Webhook` node that listens for incoming requests containing QR code data.\n   - A `Set coupon` node extracts the QR code value from the request parameters.\n\n2. **Validation of QR Code**:\n   - An `If` node checks if the QR code exists in the incoming data. If it does, the process proceeds; otherwise, a \"No coupon\" response is sent back.\n\n3. **Coupon Lookup**:\n   - The `Get Lead` node queries a Google Sheets document to check if the QR code corresponds to an existing lead.\n   - A subsequent `Not used?` node verifies whether the coupon has already been used by checking the \"USED COUPON?\" field in the sheet.\n\n4. **Lead Duplication Check**:\n   - When a new lead submits the form (`On form submission`), the `Duplicate Lead?` node checks if the email already exists in the system to prevent duplicates.\n\n5. **Coupon Assignment**:\n   - If the lead is not a duplicate, the `Get Coupon` node retrieves an available unassigned coupon from the Google Sheets document.\n   - The `Token SuiteCRM` node generates an access token for SuiteCRM, and the `Create Lead SuiteCRM` node creates a new lead entry in SuiteCRM, associating it with the assigned coupon.\n\n6. **QR Code Generation and Email Notification**:\n   - The `Get QR` node generates a QR code image URL for the assigned coupon.\n   - The `Send Email` node sends an email to the lead with the QR code attached.\n\n7. **Response Handling**:\n   - Depending on the validation results, the workflow responds with appropriate messages:\n     - \"Coupon OK\" if the coupon is valid and unused.\n     - \"Coupon KO\" if the coupon has already been used.\n     - \"Coupon not valid\" if the QR code does not exist.\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n\nTo replicate this workflow in your own n8n environment, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Configuration**:\n   - Set up an n8n instance either locally or via cloud services.\n   - Import the provided JSON configuration file into your workspace.\n   - Configure all required credentials, such as:\n     - Google Sheets OAuth2 API for accessing the spreadsheet.\n     - SuiteCRM API credentials (e.g., `SUITECRMURL`, `CLIENTID`, `CLIENTSECRET`).\n     - SMTP credentials for sending emails.\n\n2. **Customization**:\n   - Adjust the `Webhook` URL to match your deployment environment.\n   - Modify the Google Sheets document ID and sheet name in nodes like `Duplicate Lead?`, `Get Coupon`, `Update Sheet`, and `Update coupon used`.\n   - Update the SuiteCRM API endpoint and credentials in nodes like `Token SuiteCRM` and `Create Lead SuiteCRM`.\n   - Customize the email template in the `Send Email` node to match your branding and messaging requirements.\n   - Ensure the QR code generation URL in the `Get QR` node points to a valid QR code generator service.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively implement and customize this workflow to manage lead generation and coupon assignments in your organization. \n","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":29,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.emailSend":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":3}}}},"user":{"name":"Davide","username":"n3witalia","bio":"Full-stack Web Developer based in Italy specialising in Marketing & AI-powered automations.

The workflow enhances retrieval accuracy in **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** setups by ensuring each chunk retains meaningful context.\n\n**Workflow Breakdown:**\n🔹 **Google Drive** - Retrieve Document:\nThe automation starts by fetching a source document from Google Drive. This document contains structured content, with predefined boundary markers for easy segmentation.\n\n🔹 **Extract Text Content** - Once retrieved, the document’s text is extracted for processing. Special section boundary markers are used to divide the text into logical sections.\n\n🔹 **Code Node** - Create Context-Based Chunks:\nA custom code node processes the extracted text, identifying section boundaries and splitting the document into meaningful chunks. Each chunk is structured to retain its context within the entire document.\n\n🔹 **Loop Node** - Process Each Chunk:\nThe workflow loops through each chunk, ensuring they are processed individually while maintaining a connection to the overall document context.\n\n🔹 **Agent Node** - Generate Context for Each Chunk:\nWe use an Agent node powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4.0-mini via OpenRouter to generate contextual metadata for each chunk, ensuring better retrieval accuracy.\n\n🔹 **Prepend Context to Chunks & Create Embeddings** - The generated context is prepended to the original chunk, creating context-rich embeddings that improve searchability.\n\n🔹 **Google Gemini** - Text Embeddings:\nThe processed text is passed through Google Gemini text-embedding-004, which converts the text into semantic vector representations.\n\n🔹 **Pinecone Vector Store** - Store Embeddings:\nThe final embeddings, along with the enriched chunk content and metadata, are stored in Pinecone, making them easily retrievable for RAG-based AI applications.\n\n**Use Case:**\nThis automation enhances RAG retrieval by ensuring each chunk is contextually aware of the entire document, leading to more accurate AI responses. It’s perfect for applications that require semantic search, AI-powered knowledge management, or intelligent document retrieval.\n\nBy implementing context-based chunking, this workflow ensures that LLMs retrieve the most relevant data, improving response quality and accuracy in AI-driven applications.\n\n[![Video Thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/qBeWP65I4hg/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBeWP65I4hg)","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":17,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenRouter":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStorePinecone":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsGoogleGemini":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Udit Rawat","username":"ailistmaster","bio":"Hi, I’m Udit, an Acquia-certified developer with a strong background in web development and creating enterprise solutions.

This strategy guides potential customers from the online world to the physical point of sale through the provision of a coupon that can be spent in the store or on an e-commerce site.\n\nThe basic idea is to have a landing page with a form and a series of unique coupons to assign to leads as a \"reward\" for filling out the form.\n\nThis workflow is ideal for businesses looking to automate lead generation and management, especially when integrating with CRM systems like SuiteCRM and using Google Sheets for data tracking.\n\n### **How It Works**\n1. **Form Submission**:\n   - The workflow starts with the **On form submission** node, which triggers when a user submits a form on a landing page. The form collects the user's name, surname, email, and phone number.\n\n2. **Form Data Processing**:\n   - The **Form Fields** node extracts and sets the form data (name, surname, email, and phone) for use in subsequent steps.\n\n3. **Duplicate Lead Check**:\n   - The **Duplicate Lead?** node checks if the submitted email already exists in a Google Sheets document. If the email is found, the workflow responds with a \"duplicate lead\" message (**Respond KO** node) and stops further processing.\n\n4. **Coupon Retrieval**:\n   - If the email is not a duplicate, the **Get Coupon** node retrieves a coupon code from the Google Sheets document based on the lead's email.\n\n5. **Lead Creation in SuiteCRM**:\n   - The **Create Lead SuiteCRM** node creates a new lead in SuiteCRM using the form data and the retrieved coupon code. The lead includes:\n     - First name, last name, email, phone number, and coupon code.\n\n6. **Google Sheets Update**:\n   - The **Update Sheet** node updates the Google Sheets document with the newly created lead's details, including:\n     - Name, surname, email, phone, coupon code, lead ID, and the current date and time.\n\n7. **Response to Webhook**:\n   - The **Respond OK** node sends a success response back to the webhook, indicating that the lead was created successfully.\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n1. **Configure Form Trigger**:\n   - Set up the **On form submission** node to collect user data (name, surname, email, and phone) via a web form.\n\n2. **Set Up Google Sheets Integration**:\n   - Configure the **Duplicate Lead?**, **Get Coupon**, and **Update Sheet** nodes to interact with the Google Sheets document. Ensure the document contains columns for email, coupon, lead ID, and other relevant fields.\n\n3. **Set Up SuiteCRM Authentication**:\n   - Configure the **Token SuiteCRM** node with the appropriate client credentials (client ID and client secret) to obtain an access token from SuiteCRM.\n\n4. **Set Up Lead Creation in SuiteCRM**:\n   - Configure the **Create Lead SuiteCRM** node to send a POST request to SuiteCRM's API to create a new lead. Include the form data and coupon code in the request body.\n\n5. **Set Up Webhook Responses**:\n   - Configure the **Respond OK** and **Respond KO** nodes to send appropriate JSON responses back to the webhook based on whether the lead was created or if it was a duplicate.\n\n6. **Test the Workflow**:\n   - Submit a test form to ensure the workflow correctly checks for duplicates, retrieves a coupon, creates a lead in SuiteCRM, and updates the Google Sheets document.\n\n7. **Activate the Workflow**:\n   - Once tested, activate the workflow to automate the process of handling form submissions and lead creation.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Features**\n- **Duplicate Lead Check**: Prevents duplicate leads by checking if the email already exists in the Google Sheets document.\n- **Coupon Assignment**: Retrieves a coupon code from Google Sheets and assigns it to the new lead.\n- **SuiteCRM Integration**: Automatically creates a new lead in SuiteCRM with the form data and coupon code.\n- **Data Logging**: Logs all lead details in a Google Sheets document for tracking and analysis.\n- **Webhook Responses**: Provides immediate feedback on whether the lead was created successfully or if it was a duplicate.\n","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":16,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Davide","username":"n3witalia","bio":"Full-stack Web Developer based in Italy specialising in Marketing & AI-powered automations.

All of which n8n is really good at!\n\nUsing this workflow, n8n users can enjoy a variation of the Deep Research experience for themselves and their teams at a fraction of the cost. Better yet, learn and customise this Deep Research template for their businesses and/or organisations.\n\n**Check out the generated reports here:** [https://jimleuk.notion.site/19486dd60c0c80da9cb7eb1468ea9afd?v=19486dd60c0c805c8e0c000ce8c87acf](https://jimleuk.notion.site/19486dd60c0c80da9cb7eb1468ea9afd?v=19486dd60c0c805c8e0c000ce8c87acf)\n\n## How it works\n* A form is used to first capture the user's research query and how deep they'd like the researcher to go.\n* Once submitted, a blank Notion page is created which will later hold the final report and the researcher gets to work.\n* The user's query goes through a recursive series of web serches and web scraping to collect data on the research topic to generate partial learnings.\n* Once complete, all learnings are combined and given to a reasoning LLM to generate the final report.\n* The report is then written to the placeholder Notion page created earlier. \n\n## How to use\n* Duplicate this [Notion database template](https://jimleuk.notion.site/19486dd60c0c80da9cb7eb1468ea9afd?v=19486dd60c0c805c8e0c000ce8c87acf) and make sure all Notion related nodes point to it.\n* Sign-up for [APIFY.com](https://www.apify.com?fpr=414q6) API Key for web search and scraping services.\n* Ensure you have access to OpenAI's o3-mini model. Alternatively, switch this out for o1 series.\n* You must publish this workflow and ensure the form url is publically accessible.\n\n## On depth & breadth configuration\nFor more detailed reports, increase depth and breadth but be warned the workflow will take exponentially longer and cost more to complete. The recommended defaults are usually good enough.\n\nDepth=1 & Breadth=2 - will take about 10 - 15mins.\nDepth=1 & Breadth=4 - will take about 30 - 40mins.\nDpeth=3 & Breadth=5 - will take about 2 - 5 hours!\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* I deliberately chose not to use AI-powered scrapers like Firecrawl as I felt these were quite costly and quotas would be quickly exhausted. However, feel free to switch web search and scraping services which suit your environment.\n* Maybe you don't decide to source the web and instead, data collection comes from internal documents instead. This template gives you freedom to change this.\n* Experiment with different Reasoning/Thinking models such as Deepseek and Google's Gemini 2.0.\n* Finally, the LLM prompts could definitely be improved.

It integrates with IMAP email services (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) and uses AI models to streamline the email response process.\n\nThe workflow ensures that all AI-generated responses are reviewed by a human before being sent, maintaining a high level of professionalism and accuracy. This approach is particularly useful for businesses that receive a high volume of emails and need to respond quickly while ensuring quality control.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n1. **Email Trigger**:\n   - The workflow starts with the **Email Trigger (IMAP)** node, which monitors an email inbox for new messages. When a new email arrives, it triggers the workflow.\n\n2. **Email Preprocessing**:\n   - The **Markdown** node converts the email's HTML content into plain text for easier processing by the AI models.\n\n3. **Email Summarization**:\n   - The **Email Summarization Chain** node uses an AI model (OpenAI) to generate a concise summary of the email. The summary is limited to 100 words and is written in a professional tone.\n\n4. **Email Response Generation**:\n   - The **Write email** node uses an AI model (OpenAI) to draft a professional response to the email. The response is based on the email content and is limited to 100 words.\n\n5. **Human-in-the-Loop Approval**:\n   - The **Set Email text** node prepares the drafted response for approval.\n   - The **Approve Email** node sends the drafted response to a human approver (e.g., an internal email address) for review. The email includes:\n     - The original message.\n     - The AI-generated response.\n   - The **Approved?** node checks if the response has been approved by the human reviewer. If approved, the workflow proceeds to send the response; otherwise, it stops.\n\n6. **Sending the Response**:\n   - The **Send Email** node sends the approved response back to the original sender.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Features**\n- **Automated Email Summarization**: Summarizes incoming emails to provide a quick overview of the content.\n- **AI-Powered Response Generation**: Drafts professional responses to emails using AI.\n- **Human-in-the-Loop Approval**: Ensures all AI-generated responses are reviewed and approved by a human before being sent.\n- **IMAP Integration**: Works with IMAP email services like Gmail and Outlook.\n- **Efficient Email Management**: Reduces the time and effort required to handle incoming emails while maintaining high-quality responses.\n\nThis workflow is ideal for businesses looking to automate their email response process while maintaining control over the quality of outgoing communications. It leverages AI to handle repetitive tasks and ensures that all responses are reviewed by a human, providing a balance between automation and human oversight.","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":16,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.markdown":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.emailSend":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.emailReadImap":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainSummarization":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Davide","username":"n3witalia","bio":"Full-stack Web Developer based in Italy specialising in Marketing & AI-powered automations.

It uses AI models to compare a given text with a list of facts and identify potential discrepancies or hallucinations.\n\n## Components\n\n### 1. Input\n- The workflow can be initiated in two ways:\n  a) Manually via the \"When clicking 'Test workflow'\" trigger\n  b) By calling from another workflow via the \"When Executed by Another Workflow\" trigger\n- Required inputs: \n  - `facts`: A list of verified facts\n  - `text`: The text to be checked\n\n### 2. Text Preparation\n- The \"Code\" node splits the input text into individual sentences\n- Takes into account date specifications and list elements\n\n### 3. Fact Checking\n- Each sentence is individually compared with the given facts\n- Uses the \"bespoke-minicheck\" Ollama model for verification\n- The model responds with \"Yes\" or \"No\" for each sentence\n\n### 4. Filtering and Aggregation\n- Sentences marked as \"No\" (not fact-based) are filtered\n- The filtered results are aggregated\n\n### 5. Summary\n- A larger language model (Qwen2.5) creates a summary of the results\n- The summary contains:\n  - Number of incorrect factual statements\n  - List of incorrect statements\n  - Final assessment of the article's accuracy\n\n## Usage\n1. Ensure the \"bespoke-minicheck\" model is installed in Ollama (`ollama pull bespoke-minicheck`)\n2. Prepare a list of verified facts\n3. Enter the text to be checked\n4. Start the workflow\n5. The results are output as a structured summary\n\n## Notes\n- The workflow ignores small talk and focuses on verifiable factual statements\n- Accuracy depends on the quality of the provided facts and the performance of the AI models\n\n## Customization Options\n- The summarization function can be adjusted or removed to return only the raw data of the issues found\n- The AI models used can be exchanged if needed\n\nThis workflow provides an efficient method for automated fact-checking and can be easily integrated into larger systems or editorial workflows.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":18,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmOllama":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOllama":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Guido Zockoll","username":"gzockoll","bio":"I am an experienced software engineer and architect.

It starts by retrieving a podcast script from a Google Sheets document, where each speaker’s lines are clearly defined. The workflow then processes the script, generates a natural-sounding audio file with different voices for each speaker, and stores the final audio file in Google Drive.\n\nThe workflow is designed to save time and resources by automating the podcast production process, making it ideal for content creators, marketers, and businesses that need to produce high-quality audio content regularly.\n\n\n### **How It Works**\n1. **Triggering the Workflow**:\n   - The workflow starts with the **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node, which can be triggered manually to begin the process.\n\n2. **Data Retrieval**:\n   - The **Get Podcast text** node retrieves data from a Google Sheets document containing the podcast script. The document includes columns for the speaker's name and the corresponding text.\n\n3. **Data Aggregation**:\n   - The **Get all rows** node aggregates the data from the Google Sheets document, combining the speaker names and their respective text into a single dataset.\n\n4. **Text Formatting**:\n   - The **Full Podcast Text** node processes the aggregated data, formatting it into a single string where each speaker's text is prefixed with their name.\n\n5. **Audio Generation**:\n   - The **Create Audio** node sends a request to the API to generate a multi-speaker podcast audio file. The request includes the formatted text and specifies the voices for each speaker.\nWhen you register for the API service you will get 1$ for free. For continuous work add API credits to your account.\n\n6. **Status Check**:\n   - The **Get status** node checks the status of the audio generation request. If the status is \"COMPLETED\", the workflow proceeds; otherwise, it waits again.\n\n7. **Audio Retrieval**:\n   - The **Get Url Audio** node retrieves the URL of the generated audio file.\n   - The **Get File Audio** node downloads the audio file from the provided URL.\n\n8. **Audio Storage**:\n   - The **Upload Audio** node uploads the generated audio file to a specified Google Drive folder for storage.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Features**\n- **Multi-Speaker Support**: Generates podcasts with different voices for each speaker, creating a more dynamic and engaging listening experience.\n- **Google Sheets Integration**: Retrieves podcast scripts from a Google Sheets document, making it easy to manage and update content.\n- **AI-Powered Text-to-Speech**: Uses advanced AI models to generate natural-sounding audio from text.\n- **Automated Audio Generation**: Streamlines the process of creating podcast audio files, reducing the need for manual recording and editing.\n- **Google Drive Storage**: Automatically uploads the generated audio files to Google Drive for easy access and sharing.\n\nThis workflow is ideal for businesses and content creators looking to automate the production of multi-speaker podcasts. It leverages AI to handle the complex task of generating natural-sounding audio, allowing users to focus on creating compelling content.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":15,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Davide","username":"n3witalia","bio":"Full-stack Web Developer based in Italy specialising in Marketing & AI-powered automations.

\"When is the next meetup?\"\n* \"How many events are there next month?\"\n* \"Who presented most often?\"\n* \"Which future meetups have no presenters yet?\"\n\nThis workflow lets you chat with a telegram bot about past, present and future events that are scheduled in a Google Spreadsheet.\n\n(Info: This proof-of-concept was created as a demo for a hackathon of an AI & Developer Meetup in Da Nang (Vietnam) that uses a telegram group to organize)\n\n## Who it is for\n\nIf you want an easy way for your audience to get information about your events, you can us this workflow for the same purpose, or easily adapt it to your needs and different use-cases where you want to query smaller amounts of tabular data in natural language.\n\n## How it works\n\nUpon getting triggered by a chat message to a telegram bot, the schedule of meetups is retrieved from Google Spreadsheets, converted into a markdown table syntax and fed into the system prompt of an LLM (we're using OpenRouter in this example), whose output is posted back as answer into the same telegram chat.\n\n## Setup steps\n\n### TO REVIEWING IN ACTION\n\nAs the reviewer of this workflow, you can temporarily use it via an existing telegram bot, simply point your telegram client to https://t.me/AiDaNangBot and start to ask questions like:\n* \"When is the next meetup?\"\n* \"What future meetings do not have presenters?\"\n* \"Who presented on Future of Human Relationships?\"\n\n\n## To build upon this workflow:\n\n* Import the workflow\n* Customize the Google Docs credentials for your individual access\n* [Create a telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot) and connect it to the workflow by entering its API token into the credentials used in the telegram trigger node\n* In the \"Settings\" node, replace the \"scheduleURL\" with the URL of your own copy of the [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BJFS9feEy94_WgIgzWZttBwzjp09siOw1xuUgq4yuI4) or a copy of the [Event Schedule Template Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fAxGcdOZzQZpsvhiB-ULEDndb4AVKOA_B-sKoTfKvyE/edit?usp=sharing) to spin off your own – whereby the structure of the spreadsheet doesn't matter, it's just

Notifications\n\nThis workflow streamlines how new Google Form submissions are processed by automatically creating GitHub issues and sending real-time notifications to a Discord channel through a webhook.\n\n---\n\n## Who Is This Template For?\n- **Developers** looking to centralize bug reporting and issue tracking.  \n- **Project Managers** seeking an efficient way to log tasks and updates.  \n- **QA Teams** that need a fast, automated process for reporting and resolving issues.  \n\n---\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\n1. **Google Form Trigger**  \n   - The workflow begins with a **Google Sheets Trigger** node that checks for new form submissions every minute.\n\n2. **Add New Form Submissions to Google Sheets**  \n   - Each new submission is recorded in a dedicated Google Sheet for easy reference and archiving.\n\n3. **Filter Out Already Posted Issues**  \n   - An **If** node checks if the issue is already posted on GitHub by looking for an existing GitHub link in the sheet.\n\n4. **Format Message / Output Parsing**  \n   - If the issue is new, an **OpenAI Chat Model** node generates a structured output, including a title, description, and suggested fix.\n\n5. **Add Issue to GitHub**  \n   - The structured output is used to create a new issue in the specified GitHub repository.\n\n6. **Send Notification to Discord**  \n   - A Discord webhook is triggered to send a notification to your chosen channel, including a link to the newly created GitHub issue.\n\n7. **Add GitHub Link to the Sheet**  \n   - The GitHub issue link is added back to the Google Sheet for easy cross-referencing.\n\n---\n\n## Setup Steps\n\n### 1. Google Sheets Setup\n- **Create/Designate a Google Sheet:** Ensure it’s set to receive form submissions.  \n- **Configure the Trigger Node:** Provide the correct document ID and sheet name in the Google Sheets Trigger node.\n\n### 2. OpenAI Configuration\n- **API Credentials:** Set up the OpenAI Chat Model node with valid OpenAI API credentials.  \n- **Prompt Definition:** Create a prompt that formats the form submission data into a structured output (e.g., title, description, suggested fix).\n\n### 3. GitHub Configuration\n- **OAuth Credentials:** Configure the GitHub node with your GitHub OAuth credentials.  \n- **Target Repository:** Specify the repository where new issues should be created.\n\n### 4. Discord Webhook\n- **Webhook URL:** Obtain a webhook URL from your Discord server.  \n- **Notification Setup:** Use the HTTP Request node to send notifications to your chosen Discord channel.\n\n### 5. Google Sheets Update\n- **Document & Sheet Name:** Provide the same Google Sheet details used in the first step.  \n- **Add GitHub Link:** Update the corresponding row with the newly created GitHub issue link.\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Google Sheet Columns\n- **Timestamp**: Automatically recorded when the form is submitted.  \n- **Issue Title**: Generated by the OpenAI Chat Model.  \n- **Issue Description**: Detailed breakdown of the issue.  \n- **GitHub Link**: Automatically populated once the issue is created.  \n- **Discord Notification Status** (optional): Indicates whether the notification was sent successfully.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes\n- **Duplicate Prevention**: The conditional logic ensures existing issues aren’t recreated on GitHub.  \n- **AI-Powered Formatting**: OpenAI helps structure the issue details, providing clarity for developers.  \n- **Real-Time Alerts**: Discord notifications keep your entire team updated on new issues as they arise.\n","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":17,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.github":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheetsTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserStructured":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"xerang","username":"chrisv","bio":"","verified":false,"links":["https://x.com/BigMothaTrucka"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2cba99f88306da27c4d42d453aa319c7a410b2509f64faf64cf0a7ee469fd33a?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2938,"template_name":"Googleform submission to create a Github issue bug report ","unique_visitors":159,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":102,"unique_inserters":2,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":2},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2939","wf_detais":{"id":2939,"name":"n8n Subworkflow Dependency Graph & Auto-Tagging","createdAt":"2025-02-18T23:34:10.804Z","description":"## How it Works\nAs n8n instances scale, teams often lose track of sub-workflows—who uses them, where they are referenced, and whether they can be safely updated.

By automating tasks typically done manually, it saves significant time and reduces the risk of errors.\n\n## Who Is This For?\n\nThis template is perfect for:  \n- Marketers who frequently use Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, and Google Drive for document automation.  \n- Developers or technical users who manage numerous integrations and need to minimize credential creation overhead.  \n- Teams or solo users with multiple Google accounts who want to eliminate repetitive Google OAuth2 credential creation tasks.\n\n### Prerequisite Knowledge\n\n• Basic familiarity with n8n, including how to configure nodes and connect services.  \n• A Google OAuth JSON file (client ID, client secret, etc.) already set up in your Google Cloud Console.  \n• An understanding of Google services (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Contacts and others) and which you may need for your use cases\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nManually creating and naming separate OAuth2 credentials for each Google service can be time-consuming and prone to errors. For instance, if you manage 16 Google accounts, you might need to create 112 credentials manually. This workflow automates that process by using your Google OAuth JSON file and email address, generating uniquely named OAuth2 credentials for each Google service in just a single run per account.\n\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Manual Trigger** – Start the workflow on demand to generate new credentials.  \n2. **Set Node for Google OAuth Details** – Store your client ID, client secret, and other JSON info securely in one place.  \n3. **Automated Naming Convention** – Use your Google email address to create distinct names for each credential, simplifying organization.  \n4. **Array of Google Services** – Customize which services to create credentials for, such as Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drive, Gmail, Calendar, or Contacts.  \n5. **Batch Credential Creation** – Split the array of Google services and automatically create separate OAuth2 credentials for each.  \n6. **Seamless OAuth2 Integration** – Effortlessly authenticate all generated credentials within n8n.\n\n## How to Set Up\n\n1. **Insert Your JSON Details** – Paste your Google OAuth 2.0 JSON data into the “Google JSON” node.  \n2. **Add Your Google Email Address** – Specify your email address in the “Google Email” node to personalize the naming convention.  \n3. **Configure n8n Account Credentials** – In the “n8n Create Credentials” node, select or add proper credentials (e.g., n8n API credentials).  \n4. **Execute the Workflow** – Run the workflow to automatically generate individual OAuth2 credentials.  \n5. **Finalize in n8n** – Visit your n8n Credentials dashboard to complete the OAuth sign-in for each newly created credential.\n\n## Customization Options\n\n- **Modify the Services Array** – Easily add or remove Google products based on your workspace needs by editing the array in the “Services” node.  \n- **Adjust Naming Logic** – Tailor the credential naming convention in the “n8n Create Credentials” node to match your organization’s style or best practices.  \n- **Set Role-Based Access** – In n8n, control who can view and use these automatically generated credentials by adjusting user permissions.\n\n## Time-Saving Example\n\nI initially had 16 Google accounts, requiring 112 credentials if done manually. With this workflow, I needed just one run per account—saving around two hours of repetitive data entry. Yes, I spent three hours building and documenting this, but it pays off quickly for anyone managing multiple accounts or large teams.","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.n8n":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Jordan Haisley","username":"jordan","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/58d005c16818466691f5df4b50ac07a6c10113d859e538e2c9302717946273c9?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2909,"template_name":"Automate Google OAuth2 Credential Creation in n8n","unique_visitors":183,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":151,"unique_inserters":27,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":23},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2917","wf_detais":{"id":2917,"name":"Allow Users to Send a Sequence of Messages to an AI Agent in Telegram","createdAt":"2025-02-16T12:03:51.655Z","description":"### Use Case\nWhen creating chatbots that interface through applications such as **Telegram** and **WhatsApp**, users can often sends multiple shorter messages in quick succession, in place of a single, longer message. This workflow accounts for this behaviour.\n### What it Does\nThis workflow allows users to send several messages in quick succession, treating them as one coherent conversation instead of separate messages requiring individual responses. \n### How it Works\n1. When messages arrive, they are stored in a Supabase PostgreSQL table\n2. The system waits briefly to see if additional messages arrive\n3. If no new messages arrive within the waiting period, all queued messages are:\n   - Combined and processed as a single conversation\n   - Responded to with one unified reply\n   - Deleted from the queue\n### Setup\n1. Create a table in Supabase called **message_queue**. It needs to have the following columns: **user_id** (*uint8*), **message** (*text*), and **message_id** (*uint8*)\n2. Add your **Telegram**, **Supabase**, **OpenAI**, and **PostgreSQL** credentials\n3. Activate the workflow and test by sending multiple messages the Telegram bot in one go\n4.

It leverages Google Sheets for data input, a FREE language model (Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp. via OpenRouter) for generating SEO-optimized meta tags, and WooCommerce for updating product details.\n\n#### How It Works:\n1. **Trigger**: The workflow can be triggered manually or on a schedule. The manual trigger allows for testing, while the schedule trigger can be set to run at regular intervals (e.g., every few minutes) to process new products.\n   \n2. **Data Retrieval**: \n   - The workflow starts by retrieving product IDs from a Google Sheets document. It looks for products that do not yet have meta titles or descriptions.\n   - Using the retrieved product ID, the workflow fetches the corresponding product details from WooCommerce, including the product name, description, short description, and categories.\n\n3. **Meta Tag Generation**:\n   - The product details are passed to a language model (Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp) via OpenRouter. The model generates SEO-optimized meta titles and descriptions based on the provided content.\n   - The generated meta tags are structured and validated to ensure they meet SEO best practices, such as character limits and keyword inclusion.\n\n4. **Update WooCommerce**:\n   - The generated meta title and description are then updated in the WooCommerce product metadata using the Yoast SEO fields.\n\n5. **Update Google Sheets**:\n   - Finally, the workflow updates the Google Sheets document with the newly generated meta tags, along with the product URL, title, and the timestamp of the update.\n\n#### Set Up Steps:\n1. **Google Sheets Setup**:\n   - Create a copy of the provided Google Sheets template and insert WooCommerce product IDs in column \"B\".\n   - Ensure the Google Sheets document has columns for `METATITLE`, `METADESCRIPTION`, `URL`, `TITLE POST`, and `DATA` (timestamp).\n\n2. **n8n Workflow Configuration**:\n   - **Google Sheets Node**: Configure the \"Get product ID\" node to connect to your Google Sheets document. Use OAuth2 for authentication.\n   - **WooCommerce Node**: Set up the WooCommerce nodes to connect to your WooCommerce store using the WooCommerce API credentials.\n   - **OpenRouter Node**: Configure the \"Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp\" node with your OpenRouter API credentials to access the language model.\n   - **Structured Output Parser**: Ensure the output parser is set to handle the structured data format for meta titles and descriptions.\n\n3. **Workflow Execution**:\n   - Trigger the workflow manually to test the process or set up a schedule trigger to automate the workflow at regular intervals.\n   - Monitor the workflow execution to ensure that meta tags are generated and updated correctly in both WooCommerce and Google Sheets.\n\n4. **Validation**:\n   - After the workflow runs, verify that the meta titles and descriptions in WooCommerce are correctly updated and that the Google Sheets document reflects the changes.\n\nThis workflow streamlines the process of optimizing WooCommerce product pages for SEO, saving time and ensuring consistency in meta tag generation.","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":14,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.wooCommerce":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenRouter":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserStructured":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Davide","username":"n3witalia","bio":"Full-stack Web Developer based in Italy specialising in Marketing & AI-powered automations.

It may look like an expression, but in this case it is a “fixed” (literal) value used as the `Fields to Split Out` parameter value.\n\n### Dealing with names that are prefixed/suffixed with an Index\nThe next challenge with multiple attachments from a GMail message is that **each one is still assigned different name** like \"attachment_0\", \"attachment_1\", etc.  This makes it tricky to reference them in a generic way.  However, **once n8n splits the items out**, the binary in **each item is always the first (i.e. index-zero / `[0]`) and ONLY key/value**.  So, that makes it possible get the key-name and attributes of the corresponding value indirectly with some clever expression syntax.\n* `Input Data Field Name` -&gt; Expression: `{{ $binary.keys()[0] }}` - **This returns the name, regardless of whether it is \"attachment_0\", \"attachment_1\", or whatever else.**\n* Attachment file name: -&gt; Expression: `{{ $binary.values()[0].fileName }}`\n* Attachment file name extension: -&gt; Expression: `{{ $binary.values()[0].fileExtension }}`\n* Attachment file type: -&gt; Expression: `{{ $binary.values()[0].fileType }}`\n* Attachment file size (e.g. string \"100 kB\"): -&gt; Expression: `{{ $binary.values()[0].fileSize }}`\n* Attachment file size (numeric): -&gt; Expression: `{{ $binary.values()[0].fileSize.split(' ')[0].toNumber() }}`\n* Attachment mime type: -&gt; Expression: `{{ $binary.values()[0].mimeType }}`\n* Attachment id (storage GUID): -&gt; Expression: `{{ $binary.values()[0].id }}`\n\n## Flow Control\nSince each of the attachments becomes a single item, it is relatively straightforward to introduce other n8n nodes like `If`, `Switch`, or `Filter` and route each single attachment item into different workflow paths.  The template demonstrates how each attachment binary could be routed based on its file size, as an example.","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmailTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Hubschrauber","username":"hubschrauber","bio":"Software developer specializing in \"back-end plumbing\" to connect and sync data between large corporate systems, enabling application distribution/migration, scaling, and containerization.

You will build a system that accepts chat messages, retains conversation history, constructs dynamic SQL queries, and returns responses generated by an AI model. By following these instructions, you will have a working solution that integrates n8n’s AI Agent capabilities with MySQL.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure that you have the following:\n\n1. An active n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud) running version 1.50.0 or later.\n2. Valid MySQL credentials configured in n8n.\n3. API credentials for the Groq Chat Model (or your preferred AI language model).\n4. Basic familiarity with SQL and n8n node concepts such as chat triggers and memory buffers.\n5. Access to the [n8n Docs on AI Agents](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/) for further reference.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow Setup\n\n### 1. Chat Interface & Trigger\n\n- **When Chat Message Received**  \n  This node listens for incoming chat messages via a webhook. When a message arrives, it triggers the workflow immediately.\n\n### 2. Conversation Memory\n\n- **Chat History**  \n  This memory buffer node stores the last 10 interactions. It supplies conversation context to the AI Agent, ensuring that responses consider previous messages.\n\n### 3. AI Agent Core\n\n- **AI Agent (Tools Agent)**  \n  The AI Agent node orchestrates the conversation by receiving the chat input and conversation history. It dynamically generates SQL queries based on your requests and coordinates calls to external tools (such as MySQL nodes).\n\n### 4. Database Interactions\n\n- **MySQL Node**  \n  This node executes the SQL query generated by the AI Agent. You reference the query using an expression (e.g., `{{$node[\"AI Agent\"].json.sql_query}}`), allowing the agent’s output to control data retrieval.\n\n- **MySQL Schema Node**  \n  This node retrieves a list of base tables from your MySQL database (excluding system schemas). The agent uses this information to understand the available tables.\n\n- **MySQL Definition Node**  \n  This node fetches detailed metadata (such as column names, data types, and relationships) for a specific table. The table and schema names are supplied dynamically by the AI Agent.\n\n### 5. Language Model Processing\n\n- **Groq Chat Model**  \n  This node connects to the Groq Chat API to generate text completions. It processes the combined input (chat message, context, and data fetched from MySQL) and produces the final response.\n\n### 6. Guidance & Customization\n\n- **Sticky Notes**  \n  These nodes provide guidance on:\n  - Switching the chat model if you wish to use another provider (e.g., OpenAI or Anthropic).\n  - Adjusting the maximum token count per interaction.\n  - Customizing the SQL queries and the context window size.\n  \nThey help you modify the workflow to suit your environment and requirements.\n\n### Workflow Connections\n\n- The **Chat Trigger** passes the incoming message to the **AI Agent**.\n- The **Chat History** node supplies conversation context to the AI Agent.\n- The **AI Agent** calls the MySQL nodes as external tools, generating and sending dynamic SQL queries.\n- The **Groq Chat Model** processes the consolidated input from the agent and outputs the natural language response delivered to the user.\n\n### Testing the Workflow\n\n1. Send a chat message using the chat interface.\n2. Observe how the AI Agent processes the input and generates a corresponding SQL query.\n3. Verify that the MySQL nodes execute the query and return data.\n4. Confirm that the Groq Chat Model produces a coherent natural language response.\n5. Refer to the sticky notes for guidance if you need to fine-tune any node settings.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps and References\n\n- **Customize Your AI Model**  \n  Replace the Groq Chat Model with another language model (such as the OpenAI Chat Model) by updating the node credentials and configuration.\n\n- **Enhance Memory Settings**  \n  Adjust the Chat History node’s context window to retain more or fewer messages based on your needs.\n\n- **Modify SQL Queries**  \n  Update the SQL queries in the MySQL nodes to match your specific database schema and desired data.\n\n- **Further Reading**  \n  Consult the [n8n Docs on AI Agents](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/) for additional details and examples to expand your workflow’s capabilities.\n\n- **Set Up a Website Chatbot**\n  Copy & Paste and replace the placeholders in the following code to embed the chatbot into your personal or company's website: [View in CodePen 🡥](https://codepen.io/olemai/pen/RNwPdVp)\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, you will deploy a robust AI chatbot workflow that integrates with your MySQL database, allowing you to query data using natural language.\n","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":11,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.mySqlTool":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatGroq":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Gegenfeld","username":"gegenfeld","bio":"We at Gegenfeld are an EdTech platform dedicated to delivering high-quality on-demand courses and interactive training sessions for professional development at all skill levels.

Split testing is a good method for doing this.\n### What it Does\nThis workflow randomly assigns chat sessions to one of two prompts, the baseline and the alternative. The agent will use the same prompt for all interactions in that chat session.\n### How it Works\n1. When messages arrive, a table containing information regarding session ID and which prompt to use is checked to see if the chat already exists\n2. If it does not, the session ID is added to the table and a prompt is randomly assigned\n3. These values are then used to generate a response\n\n### Setup\n1. Create a table in Supabase called **split_test_sessions**. It needs to have the following columns: **session_id** (`text`) and **show_alternative** (`bool`)\n2. Add your **Supabase**, **OpenAI**, and **PostgreSQL** credentials\n3. Modify the **Define Path Values** node to set the baseline and alternative prompt values.\n4. Activate the workflow and test by sending messages through n8n's inbuilt chat\n5. Experiment with different chat sessions to test see both prompts in action\n\n### Next Steps\n- Modify the workflow to test different LLM settings such as temperature\n- Add a method to measure the efficacy of the two alternative prompts\n\n","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":16,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.supabase":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":7},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryPostgresChat":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Chris Carr","username":"chriscarr","bio":"Founder of bsde.ai, a workflow and AI agency based in the UK.","verified":true,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriscarr-bsde/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/dfa8cbb7687f4d9a149258d2dd59e6f0131d835b4dc768858afe6bd1d497dc92?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2992,"template_name":"Split Test Different Agent Prompts with Supabase and OpenAI","unique_visitors":436,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":301,"unique_inserters":49,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":33},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2993","wf_detais":{"id":2993,"name":"Copy Viral Reels with Gemini AI","createdAt":"2025-02-24T10:38:34.868Z","description":"### Video Guide\n\nI prepared a detailed guide that shows the whole process of building an AI tool to analyze Instagram Reels using n8n.\n\n[![Youtube Thumbnail](https://res.cloudinary.com/de9jgixzm/image/upload/v1740390927/Youtube%20Thumbs/Video_21_-_Philipp_Instagram_Blur.png)](https://youtu.be/SQPPM0KLsrM)\n\n[Youtube Link](https://youtu.be/SQPPM0KLsrM)\n\n### Who is this for?\nThis workflow is ideal for social media analysts, digital marketers, and content creators who want to leverage data-driven insights from their Instagram Reels.

Whether you want to create social media graphics, placeholder images, or text-based LinkedIn carousels, this workflow provides a simple, no-code solution using an API that requires no authentication.\n\n## What problem does this workflow solve?\n\nCreating text-based images often requires design software or complex integrations with graphic tools. This workflow eliminates that hassle by allowing users to generate images with custom text, font styles, colors, and background colors using a simple HTTP request. It’s perfect for automating image generation without relying on external tools or manual effort.\n\n## What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow leverages an HTTP request to a free API that generates text-based images dynamically. Here's what it enables you to do:\n\n- Define custom image text\n- Set image dimensions (width x height)\n- Choose a background color and text color using hex codes\n- Select a font family and font size\n- Specify the image format (PNG, JPG, or WebP)\n\nThe generated image can be used immediately, making it ideal for automating content creation workflows.\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Open the workflow in n8n.\n2. Modify the Set node to define your preferred image properties:\n```\n- text: The message displayed on the image.\n- size: Image dimensions (e.g., 500x300 pixels).\n- backgroundColor: Hex color code for the background.\n- textColor: Hex color code for the text.\n- fontFamily: Select from available font options (e.g., Pacifico, Ubuntu).\n- fontSize: Define the text size.\n- type: Choose the image format (PNG, JPG, or WebP).\n```\n\n3. Execute the workflow to generate an image.\n4. The HTTP request returns the generated image, ready for use.\n\n## How to customize this workflow\n\n- 1.     Adjust the Set node values to match your desired design.\n- 2.     Use dynamic data for text, allowing personalized images based on user input.\n- 3.     Automate image delivery by adding email or social media posting nodes.\n- 4.

Cloud-based n8n instances currently do not support community nodes.  \n\n## Summary\n\nThis workflow template allows you to **dynamically run SuiteQL queries in NetSuite** by sending an HTTP request to an n8n Webhook node. Once triggered, the workflow uses token-based authentication to execute your SuiteQL query and returns the results as JSON. This makes it easy to integrate real-time NetSuite data into dashboards, reporting tools, or other applications.\n\n## Who Is This For?\n\n- **Developers & Integrators**: Easily embed NetSuite data retrieval into custom apps or internal tools.  \n- **Enterprises & Consultants**: Integrate dynamic reporting or data enrichment from NetSuite without manual exports.  \n- **System Administrators**: Automate routine queries and reduce manual intervention.\n\n## Use Cases & Benefits\n\n### 1. Dynamic Data Access\nSend any SuiteQL query on demand instead of hardcoding queries or manually running reports.\n\n### 2. Seamless Integration\nQuickly pull NetSuite data into front-end systems (like Excel dashboards, custom web apps, or internal tools) by calling the webhook endpoint.\n\n### 3. Simplified Reporting\nAutomate data extraction and formatting, reducing the need for manual exports and improving efficiency.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Trigger**:  \n   - An HTTP request to the webhook node initiates the workflow.  \n\n2. **Input Processing**:  \n   - The workflow reads the SuiteQL query from the incoming request parameter (`suiteql`).  \n\n3. **Query Execution**:  \n   - The NetSuite node uses your token-based authentication credentials to run the SuiteQL query.  \n\n4. **Response**:  \n   - Results are returned as JSON in the HTTP response, ready for further processing or immediate consumption.\n\n## Prerequisites & Setup\n\n1. **NetSuite Community Node**  \n   - This workflow requires the NetSuite community node. Make sure your **self-hosted** n8n instance supports community nodes.\n\n2. **NetSuite Token-Based Authentication**  \n   - Enable TBA in NetSuite. Obtain the required consumer key, consumer secret, token ID, and token secret.\n\n3. **n8n Webhook**  \n   - Copy the auto-generated webhook URL (e.g. `http://&lt;your-n8n-domain&gt;/webhook/unique-id`) from the Webhook node.\n\n4. **Usage**  \n   - Send an HTTP GET or POST request to the webhook with your SuiteQL query. For example:  \n     ```sh\n     curl \"http://&lt;your-n8n-domain&gt;/webhook/unique-id?suiteql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20account%20LIMIT%2010\"\n     ```  \n   - The workflow will execute the query and return JSON data.\n\n## Customization\n\n- **Change the Query**:  \n  Simply adjust the `suiteql` parameter in your HTTP request to run different SuiteQL statements.\n\n- **Data Transformation**:  \n  Insert nodes (e.g., Function, Set, or Format) to modify or reformat the data before returning it.\n\n- **Extend Integration**:  \n  Chain additional nodes to push the retrieved data to other services (Google Sheets, Slack, custom dashboards, etc.).\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- Remember that this template is **only compatible with self-hosted n8n** because it uses a community node. - \n[netsuite community node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-netsuite\n)\n- If you have questions, suggestions, or need support, contact us at [support@dataants.org](mailto:support@dataants.org).\n\n---\n","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":3,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-netsuite.netsuite":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"DataAnts","username":"dataants","bio":"Data Analytics and Automation Consultant with more than 8 years of experience in the NetSuite, ERP and Financial reporting space","verified":false,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/company/35581985"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/08ed50db1d4c1a045dcf08a66ed03b89a552e492860fafce317e84cab17b0613?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":3002,"template_name":" Dynamically Run SuiteQL Queries in NetSuite via HTTP Webhook in n8n","unique_visitors":134,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":122,"unique_inserters":17,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":14},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/3004","wf_detais":{"id":3004,"name":"🚀 TikTok Video Automation Tool ✨ – Highly Optimized with OpenAI & Replicate","createdAt":"2025-02-24T22:44:59.697Z","description":"## 🚀 TikTok Video Automation Tool ✨ (Frequent Updates) \n**Create viral TikTok videos effortlessly — no editing skills required!**\n\n### **Who is this for? 🎯**  \n✅ **Content Creators:** Pump out engaging short videos in minutes.  \n✅ **Marketing Agencies:** Deliver high-quality client content — fast.\n✅ **Business Owners:** Promote your brand with attention-grabbing TikToks.  \n\n### **What problem does this solve? 🛠️**  \nShort-form video content is king, but creating it takes **time, skill, and effort**.

analysts** needing structured lead data.  \n- **CRM administrators** automating lead imports.  \n\n### What Problem Does This Solve?  \nAutomates extraction of Facebook form leads, resolves inconsistent field naming (e.g., `\"programo\"` → `\"program\"`), and prepares data for seamless integration with CRMs like HubSpot, analytics tools, or databases.  \n\n### Key Features  \n- **Pagination Handling**: Limits of 10,000 records per API call to avoid complexity.  \n- **Field Standardization**: Renames and orders fields (e.g., `source`, `medium`, `email`) for consistency.  \n- **Data Simplification**: Extracts first values from multi-value fields.  \n- **Flexibility**: Easily extendable to send data to 100+ apps via n8n integrations.  \n\n### How It Works  \n1. **Trigger**: Start manually or schedule the workflow.  \n2. **Form Retrieval**: Fetch all leadgen forms from your Facebook Page.  \n3. **Data Preparation**:  \n   - Split bulk data into individual records.  \n   - Filter forms by name (case-insensitive).  \n4. **Lead Extraction**: Get raw lead data with metadata (ad campaigns, timestamps).  \n5. **Data Transformation**:  \n   - **Code Node**: Renames fields and enforces canonical order.  \n   - **Set Node**: Exposes normalized fields (e.g., `field_data.email`).  \n6. **Output**: Structured data ready for CRM/analytics tools.  \n\n### Setup Guide  \n1. **Facebook Configuration**:  \n   - Replace `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with your Facebook Page ID.  \n   - Ensure `leadgen_forms` API access in [Meta Developer Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/).  \n2. **Customization**:  \n   - Adjust field mappings in the **Code - Order fields** node if needed.  \n   - Add nodes to send data to your CRM (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce).  \n\n### Customization Tips  \n- **Add Error Handling**: Include an IF node to flag incomplete records.  \n- **Enrich Data**: Use nodes like Clearbit to append company info.  \n- **Automate**: Replace the manual trigger with a schedule or webhook.  \n\n### Why This Works  \n- **Time Savings**: Reduces manual data cleaning by 80%.  \n- **Scalability**: Processes 10,000+ leads per run.  \n- **Adaptability**: Handles multilingual or inconsistently named form fields.  \n\n---  \n**Tags**: Facebook Lead Ads, CRM Integration, Data Normalization, Marketing

Users can control many customizable parameters, such as key topic, number of subtopics, target audience, length, and style.  \n2. **Initial Research:** The workflow initiates preliminary research on the topic to gather insights for the content planning phase.  \n3. **Structure Planning:** Based on the initial research, it plans a detailed structure for the entire article and breaks the article into subtopics strongly tied to the main topic.  \n4. **In-Depth Research & Writing:** For each subtopic, it conducts further research to gather the most up-to-date, relevant information, then uses that research to write each chapter in depth.  \n5. **Image Generation:** It generates and adds images for each chapter, as well as a featured image for the article.  \n6. **Internal Linking:** The system gathers internal website links and strategically embeds them within each chapter and throughout the article, boosting SEO and enhancing user navigation.  \n7. **Final Assembly & Publishing:** All texts, images, and links are combined into one comprehensive article, which is then published directly to your WordPress website. You can also choose to post it as a draft for final review.  \n8. **Auto Backup to Drive:** Get peace of mind knowing all content (blog post and images) is automatically saved to Google Drive, organized in a folder named after the blog post title.\n\n---\n\n## Unique Features\n\n1. **Deep Research:** The workflow leverages advanced, real-time research to gather the latest information about a topic. It breaks down the key topic into subtopics and conducts in-depth research on each one, ensuring the most comprehensive and current knowledge.  \n2. **Full Automation:** Designed to be 100% automated, the workflow runs without manual intervention once imported and configured.  \n3. **Simple Activation:** It is easily triggered through the Google Sheets interface—simply add a new row to a Google Sheet.  \n4. **Customization Options:** Offers a wide array of options, including topic, category, target audience, word count, number of chapters, length of introduction and conclusion, and writing style. It also allows for the inclusion of calls-to-action (CTAs) and company/product introductions.  \n5. **Advanced Loop in Loop:** Clever looping is used to write each chapter and generate images, ensuring optimal results. “Wait” nodes are added where appropriate to avoid API call rate limits.  \n6. **Automatic Content Saving:** After the blog post is created, all content and images are automatically saved to Google Drive, preventing data loss. The folder is named after the blog post title.  \n7. **SEO-Optimized Content:** It is designed to create SEO-optimized content using seed keywords.  \n8. **Internal Link Limit:** The workflow limits the number of internal links to 20 by default.  \n9. **Error Catch:** “If” nodes are strategically used to ensure that the output from AI nodes strictly meets the JSON schema, ensuring a smooth flow of data without interruption.\n\nAnd many more big and small improvements.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\nPlease make sure you have these requirements ready to ensure smooth deployment of this n8n workflow template:\n\n1. **OpenAI API** or equivalent for text and image generation  \n2. **PerplexityAI API** or equivalent for online research  \n3. A **WordPress** website (other website platforms will not work\\!)  \n4. Google Sheets for triggering the workflow, or a trigger of your choice  \n5. Google Drive and Google Docs for auto backup\n\n---\n\n## Set Up Steps\n\n1. **Install the Workflow Template:** Import the JSON files into your n8n instance. There are 2 files: one for the main workflow and one for the research tool (PerplexityAI).  \n2. **Connect the Workflow with Your Accounts:** Link your accounts for OpenAI API, PerplexityAI API, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Google Docs, and WordPress website.  \n3. **Configure the Google Sheet:** Ensure your Google Sheet is set up to trigger the workflow upon adding a new row and that the input data is correctly formatted.  \n4. **Customize the Inputs:** Adjust parameters like topic, target audience, and writing style to match your specific content needs. Optimize prompts for the best results.  \n5. **Test the Workflow:** Use low-cost AI models and image settings initially to ensure everything runs smoothly.  \n6. **Tailor Further as Needed:**  Modify workflow elements to perfectly align with your needs and content strategy.\n\n---\n\n## Tips for PROs\n\n1. **Image Generation:** The default AI model for image generation is OpenAI’s Dall-E. However, the outputs of this model are not impressive. Consider using FLUX.1 for better image quality.  \n2. **Research:** PerplexityAI is the tool of choice for research. The default model used in this workflow is “sonar” due to its fast speed and low cost. Feel free to experiment with its other models, including the “sonar-deep-research” model, which is dedicated to deep research.  \n3. **Triggering:** Triggering with a new row on Google Sheets is limited and unreliable. Consider setting an auto trigger with a daily schedule at a specific time. You can even put the whole workflow in a loop to process multiple rows one-by-one from Google Sheets.  \n4. **Human in the Loop:** It is possible to incorporate a human review process. For example, after the article is posted to WordPress as a draft, a human can review the draft. Only after approval will the post be published, and a final copy of the post will be saved to the shared Drive folder.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":77,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.xml":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.limit":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.markdown":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.editImage":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.wordpress":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDocs":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":15},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheetsTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":4},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolWorkflow":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserStructured":{"count":3}}}},"user":{"name":"Daniel Ng","username":"danielng","bio":"A Growth Hacker, Digital Marketer & AI Automation Builder with 10+ years of experience in Digital Marketing & Automation.

It highlights two key behaviors:\n\n- **Built-In Looping:** By default, most n8n nodes iterate over each item in an input array.\n- **Explicit Looping:** The **Loop Over Items** node allows controlled iteration, enabling **custom batch processing** and multi-step workflows.\n\nThis workflow demonstrates the difference between processing an **unsplit array of strings (single item)** vs. **a split array (multiple items)**.\n\n---\n\n## Setup\n\n### 1. Input Data\n\nTo begin, **paste the following JSON** into the **Manual Trigger** node:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"urls\": [\n    \"https://www.reddit.com\",\n    \"https://www.n8n.io/\",\n    \"https://n8n.io/\",\n    \"https://supabase.com/\",\n    \"https://duckduckgo.com/\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n📌 **Steps to Paste Data:**\n- **Double-click** the \"Manual Trigger\" node.\n- Click **\"Edit Output\"** (top-right corner).\n- Paste the JSON and **Save**.\n- The node **turns purple**, indicating that test data is pinned.\n\n### 1. Click \"Test Workflow\" button at the bottom of the canvas\n\n\n---\n\n## Explanation of the n8n Nodes in the Workflow\n\n| Node Name | Purpose | Documentation Link |\n|-----------|---------|--------------------|\n| **[Manual Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualtrigger/)** | Starts the workflow manually and sends test data | [Docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualtrigger/) |\n| **[Split Out](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/)** | Converts an array of strings into separate JSON objects | [Docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/) |\n| **[Loop Over Items (Loop Over Items 1)](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/)** | Demonstrates how an **unsplit** array is treated as one item | [Docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) |\n| **[Loop Over Items (Loop Over Items 2)](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/)** | Iterates over **each item separately** | [Docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) |\n| **[Wait](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/)** | Introduces a delay per iteration (set to 1 second) | [Docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) |\n| **[Code](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/)** | Adds a constant parameter (`param1`) to each item | [Docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) |\n| **[NoOp (Result Nodes)](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.noop/)** | Displays output for inspection | [Docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.noop/) |\n\n---\n\n## Execution Details\n\n### 1. How the Workflow Runs\n\n- **Manual Trigger starts execution** with the pasted JSON data.\n- The workflow follows **two paths**:\n  1. **Unsplit Array Path** → **Loop Over Items 1**  \n     - Processes the entire array as **a single item**.\n     - **Result1 & Result5:** Show that the array was **not split**.\n  \n  2. **Split Array Path** → **Split Out → Loop Over Items 2**\n     - **Splits** the array into **separate objects**.\n     - **Result2, Result3, Result4:** Show that each item is processed **individually**.\n     - A **Wait node (1 sec delay)** demonstrates **controlled execution**.\n     - Code nodes modify the JSON, adding a parameter (`param1`).\n\n### 2. What You Will See\n\n| Node | Expected Output |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Result1 & Result5** | The entire array is processed **as one item**. |\n| **Result2, Result3, Result4** | The array is **split and processed** as **individual items**. |\n| **Wait Node** | Adds a **1-second delay per item** in **Loop Over Items 2**. |\n\n---\n\n## Use Cases\n\nThis workflow is useful for:\n\n✅ **API Data Processing:** Loop through **API responses** containing arrays.  \n✅ **Web Scraping:** Process **multiple URLs** individually.  \n✅ **Task Automation:** Execute **a sequence of actions per item**.  \n✅ **Workflow Optimization:** Control execution order, delays, and dependencies.\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- Sticky notes are included in the workflow **for easy reference**.\n- The **Wait node** is **optional**—remove it for faster execution.\n- This template is structured for **beginners** but serves as a **building block** for more advanced automations.\n\n---\n\n","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":21,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Dominik Baranowski","username":"dom","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/412926a58d669d9ba17342ac8c447255b43d50797cfe53353a41dacabd98de17?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2896,"template_name":"N8N for Beginners: Looping over Items","unique_visitors":604,"unique_weekly_visitors":1,"unique_monthly_visitors":600,"unique_inserters":137,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":137},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2901","wf_detais":{"id":2901,"name":"Convert Notion to Markdown and Back to Notion","createdAt":"2025-02-13T19:19:23.284Z","description":"This workflow converts Notion pages to markdown, and then converts that markdown back to Notion blocks.

Choose other authentication methods if needed.\n   - Ensure the user account has the following permissions: `can create on DAG Runs`, `can read on DAG Runs`, `can read on XComs`, `can edit on DAGs`, and `can read on DAGs`.\n\n## How to Use:\n\nTo execute this workflow, use the **Execute Sub-workflow** node with the following input parameters:\n\n- **dag\\_id**: The DAG ID (name) in Airflow that you want to trigger.\n- **task\\_id**: The Task ID (name) from which you want to retrieve the XCom return\\_value.\n- **conf**: Input data for the Airflow DAG run.\n- **wait**: Delay (in seconds) between each `Airflow: dag_run - state` check.\n- **wait\\_time**: The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for `Airflow: dag_run - state` before returning an error.\n\n## Output:\n\n- The workflow returns the XCom result from `Airflow: dag_run - get result`.\n- The XCom `return_value` is stored in the `value` field.\n","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":12,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stopAndError":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Antonio Cheong","username":"windoac","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/fbc7bb10b6bc8af6a9c2c2d91bcb695ff173ffb70f8c2aec4149719886fce3e0?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":3026,"template_name":"Run Apache Airflow DAG and Retrieve XCom Value","unique_visitors":69,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":66,"unique_inserters":5,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":5},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/3043","wf_detais":{"id":3043,"name":"🤖 AI-Powered WhatsApp Assistant for Restaurants & Delivery Automation","createdAt":"2025-02-28T18:27:41.731Z","description":"# **AI-Powered WhatsApp Assistant for Restaurant & Delivery – Automate Orders, Calculate Delivery Fees & Enhance Customer Service with n8n**\n\n📌 **Optimize your restaurant's delivery process with AI-powered automation!**  \nThis **n8n** workflow enables an intelligent WhatsApp assistant for **restaurants, burger joints, and delivery businesses**.

It allows users to interact with your bot by selecting options from a Telegram bot menu, *without* needing to type out full instructions or rely on conversational AI. This approach offers precise control and predictable behavior for command-driven interactions.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   🤖 **Structured Command Handling:** Unlike approaches that rely on conversational AI (like the \"AI Agent\" node), this template provides a *deterministic* way to handle specific commands triggered by users selecting options from a Telegram bot menu. Users do *not* need to write out full instructions.\n*   ➕ **Command-Based Interaction (Extensible):** Ready to process three commands (`/command1`, `/command2`, `/command3`), and easily extensible to support additional commands.\n*   🚦 **Clear Command Routing:** Employs `Switch` nodes to efficiently route execution based on both the initial command and the current conversation state.\n*   💬 **Content Requesting:** Prompts the user to provide content after a command is received. This is handled by dedicated `Telegram` nodes.\n*   🛠️ **Easy Customization:** Includes placeholder (`No Operation, do nothing`) nodes where you can easily insert your own custom processing logic for each command.\n\n**Why This Template is Unique:**\n\nn8n currently lacks a native, built-in mechanism for handling individual Telegram commands in a structured, non-conversational way. Many users resort to \"AI Agent\" nodes, which are designed for open-ended conversations. This template fills that gap by providing a framework for:\n\n*   ✅ **Predefined Commands:** Users interact with your bot through a menu of predefined commands, eliminating the need for complex natural language processing.\n*   🧠 **Deterministic Behavior:** The workflow's response is predictable and directly tied to the selected command, unlike AI-driven approaches where responses can be less consistent.\n*   🖱️ **Simplified Interaction:** Users simply click a button in the Telegram menu, making the interaction intuitive and user-friendly.\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1.  **Initialization (One-Time):** Execute the \"Temp to Initiate Static Data\" node *once* to create the necessary `telegramStates` object in the workflow's static data. This is crucial for state management.\n2.  **Customize Processing Logic:** Replace the `NoOp` nodes (`Command1 processing`, `Command2 processing`, `Command3 processing`) with your own nodes to handle the content received for each command. *It is highly recommended to add input validation within your processing logic.*\n3.  **Telegram Credentials:** Configure the `Telegram Trigger` and `Telegram` nodes with your bot's API token.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\nThis template is ideal for creating bots that require a command followed by specific input, such as:\n\n*   📊 **Data Collection:** A command to initiate a form, followed by a request for the data.\n*   🛠️ **Service Requests:** A command to request a service, followed by a request for details.\n*   📚 **Interactive Tutorials:** A command to start a tutorial, followed by a request of completion.","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":25,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.telegramTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Daniel Jimenez","username":"ldaniel-jmz","bio":"I specialize in building custom integrations for businesses, focusing on appointment systems, CRM-integrated chatbots, and data collection workflows.

We then want to drill down to answer specific questions that we require the answer to. When doing this, we don't want to ask duplicate questions. This particular scenario imagines an AI consultancy capturing leads.\n## What it Does\nThis workflow requires users to input basic information and then answer an open ended question. The specific questions on the next page will only be those that weren't answered in the open-ended question.\n## How it Works\n1. The open-ended question (and relevant basic information) is analysed by an LLM to determine which specific questions have not been answered. Chain-of-thought reasoning is utilised and the output structure is specified with the **Structured Output Parser**.\n2. Those questions that have already been answered are filtered out nodes. The remaining items are then used to generate the last page of the form.\n3. Once the user has filled in the final page of the form, they are shown a form completion page.\n## Setup\n1.

It allows users to submit a form with the message content, recipient's phone number, voice type, and language, and then sends a voice call with the provided text. \n\nThis workflow is a simple yet powerful way to automate text-to-speech voice calls using API. It’s ideal for notifications, reminders, or any scenario where voice communication is needed.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the workflow:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. How It Works**\nThe workflow is designed to send voice calls with text-to-speech functionality. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Form Submission**:\n   - The workflow starts with a **Form Trigger** node, where users submit a form with the following fields:\n     - **Body**: The text message to be converted to speech (max 600 characters).\n     - **To**: The recipient's phone number (including the international prefix, e.g., +39xxxxxxxxxx).\n     - **Voice**: The voice type (male or female).\n     - **Lang**: The language for the voice call (e.g., en-us, it-it, fr-fr, etc.).\n   - Once the form is submitted, the workflow is triggered.\n\n2. **Send Voice Call**:\n   - The **Send Voice** node sends a POST request to the **ClickSend API** (`https://rest.clicksend.com/v3/voice/send`).\n   - The request includes:\n     - The **text message** (Body) to be converted to speech.\n     - The **recipient's phone number** (To).\n     - The **voice type** (Voice).\n     - The **language** (Lang).\n     - **Machine detection** is enabled to detect if the call is answered by a machine.\n   - The API processes the request and initiates a voice call to the specified number, where the text is read aloud by the selected voice.\n\n3. **Outcome**:\n   - The recipient receives a voice call, and the submitted text is read aloud in the chosen voice and language.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Set Up Steps**\nTo set up and use this workflow in n8n, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Register on ClickSend**:\n   - Go to [ClickSend](https://clicksend.com/?u=586989) and create an account.\n   - Obtain your **API Key** and take advantage of the **2 € free credits** provided.\n\n2. **Configure ClickSend API in n8n**:\n   - In the **Send Voice** node, set up **HTTP Basic Authentication**:\n     - **Username**: Use the username you registered with on ClickSend.\n     - **Password**: Use the **API Key** provided by ClickSend.\n\n3. **Set Up the Form Trigger**:\n   - The **Form Trigger** node is pre-configured with fields for:\n     - **Body**: The text message to be converted to speech.\n     - **To**: The recipient's phone number.\n     - **Voice**: Choose between male or female voice.\n     - **Lang**: Select the language for the voice call.\n   - Customize the form fields if needed (e.g., add more languages or voice options).\n\n4. **Test the Workflow**:\n   - Submit the form with the required details (text, phone number, voice, and language).\n   - The workflow will send a voice call to the specified number, and the recipient will hear the text read aloud.\n\n5. **Optional Customization**:\n   - Modify the workflow to include additional features, such as:\n     - Adding more languages or voice options.\n     - Sending multiple voice calls in bulk.\n     - Integrating with other APIs or services for advanced use cases.\n","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":5,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Davide","username":"n3witalia","bio":"Full-stack Web Developer based in Italy specialising in Marketing & AI-powered automations.

It's especially useful for creators who include a standard set of links in their descriptions and need to insert a new link between existing ones across multiple videos.\n## What problem does this workflow solve?\n\nManually updating video descriptions for multiple videos can be tedious and time-consuming. If you have a section in your video descriptions that contains important links, adding a new one in a specific position (e.g., between two existing links) can be a challenge. This workflow automates that process, allowing you to insert a specific string between two predefined rows in all of your video descriptions at once.\n## What this workflow does\n\n1. Fetches all videos from your YouTube channel.\n2. Iterates through each video to retrieve its existing description.\n3. Identifies two predefined rows in the description.\n4. Inserts a new row between the two specified rows.\n5. Updates the video description with the modified text.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Connect your YouTube account to n8n and grant necessary permissions.\n2. Define your variables in the \"Set String to Insert\" node:\n   - **rowBefore**: The existing row after which the new row will be inserted.\n   - **rowToInsert**: The new text or link to insert.\n   - **rowAfter**: The existing row before which the new row will be inserted.\n3. Run the workflow using the manual trigger.\n4. Review the updated descriptions to ensure accuracy.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- **Change the insertion criteria** by modifying the rowBefore and rowAfter values.\n- **Insert multiple rows** by adjusting the JavaScript code in the Code node.\n- **Extend the workflow** by adding conditions (e.g., only updating descriptions of videos with certain tags).\n- **Filter specific** videos instead of updating all by modifying the \"Get All Videos\" node.\n\nThis workflow ensures that all your YouTube descriptions stay updated and consistent with minimal effort.","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":9,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.youTube":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Akram Kadri","username":"akramkadri","bio":"n8n Automation Freelancer\n------------------------\nContact me at: akram@digispruce.com","verified":true,"links":["https://youtube.com/@kadri_akram"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e57785a112fbcca1ac70d537a9ed5c5a68be59f808ed8b36475bde0e2c8f384b?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":3080,"template_name":"Automatically Update YouTube Video Descriptions with Inserted Text","unique_visitors":236,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":234,"unique_inserters":44,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":44},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/3084","wf_detais":{"id":3084,"name":"Send SMS via ClickSend API Worldwide without a Phone number","createdAt":"2025-03-05T10:23:44.925Z","description":"This workflow allows you to send SMS messages globally using API without needing a physical phone number. \n\n#### **1.

The workflow is particularly valuable during brainstorming sessions for new projects, when conducting domain portfolio audits, or when preparing domain acquisition strategies. \n\nBy automating the domain availability check process, users can quickly identify available domains for registration without the hassle of navigating through multiple web interfaces.\n\n## Who is this for?\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n- Domain investors and flippers who need to check multiple domains quickly\n- Web developers and agencies evaluating domain options for client projects\n- Digital marketers researching domain availability for campaigns\n- Business owners exploring domain options for new ventures\n- IT professionals managing domain portfolios\n\nUsers should have basic familiarity with n8n workflow concepts and a Namesilo account to obtain an API key. No coding knowledge is required, though understanding of domain name systems would be beneficial.\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving?\nChecking domain availability one-by-one is a time-consuming and tedious process, especially when dealing with dozens or hundreds of potential domains. This workflow solves several key challenges:\n\n1. **Manual Inefficiency**: Eliminates the need to individually search for each domain through registrar websites.\n2. **Rate Limiting**: Handles API rate limits automatically with built-in waiting periods.\n3. **Data Organization**: Compiles availability results into a structured Excel file rather than scattered notes or multiple browser tabs.\n4. **Bulk Processing**: Processes up to 200 domains per batch, with the ability to handle unlimited domains across multiple batches.\n5. **Time Management**: Frees up valuable time that would otherwise be spent on repetitive manual checks.\n\n## What this workflow does\n### Overview\nThe workflow takes a list of domains, processes them in batches of up to 200 domains per request (to comply with API limitations), checks their availability using the Namesilo API, and compiles the results into an Excel spreadsheet showing which domains are available for registration and which are already taken.\n\n### Process\n1. **Input Setup**: The workflow begins with a manual trigger and uses the \"Set Data\" node to collect the list of domains to check and your Namesilo API key.\n2. **Domain Processing**: The \"Convert & Split Domains\" node transforms the input list into batches of up to 200 domains to comply with API limitations.\n3. **Batch Processing**: The workflow loops through each batch of domains.\n4. **API Integration**: For each batch, the \"Namesilo Requests\" node sends a request to the Namesilo API to check domain availability.\n5. **Data Parsing**: The \"Parse Data\" node processes the API response, extracting information about which domains are available and which are taken.\n6. **Rate Limit Management**: A 5-minute wait period is enforced between batches to respect Namesilo's API rate limits.\n7. **Data Compilation**: The \"Merge Results\" node combines all the availability data.\n8. **Output Generation**: Finally, the \"Convert to Excel\" node creates an Excel file with two columns: Domain and Availability (showing \"Available\" or \"Unavailable\" for each domain).\n\n## Setup\n1. **Import the workflow**: Download the workflow JSON file and import it into your n8n instance.\n2. **Get Namesilo API key**: Create a free account at Namesilo and obtain your API key from https://www.namesilo.com/account/api-manager\n3. **Configure the workflow**:\n   - Open the \"Set Data\" node\n   - Enter your Namesilo API key in the \"Namesilo API Key\" field\n   - Enter your list of domains (one per line) in the \"Domains\" field\n4. **Save and activate**: Save the workflow and run it using the manual trigger.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n- **Modify domain input format**: You can adjust the code in the \"Convert & Split Domains\" node if your domain list comes in a different format.\n- **Change batch size**: If needed, you can modify the batch size (currently set to 200) in the \"Convert & Split Domains\" node to accommodate different API limitations.\n- **Adjust wait time**: If you have a premium API account with different rate limits, you can modify the wait time in the \"Wait\" node.\n- **Enhance output format**: Customize the \"Convert to Excel\" node to add additional columns or formatting to the output file.\n- **Add domain filtering**: You could add a node before the API request to filter domains based on specific criteria (length, keywords, TLDs).\n- **Integrate with other services**: Connect this workflow to domain registrars to automatically register available domains that meet your criteria.","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":10,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.convertToFile":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"n8n custom workflows","username":"n8ncustomworkflows","bio":"We specializes in crafting tailored automation solutions that help businesses streamline their operations and boost productivity.

Watch the full breakdown here: [📺 Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj_XpLSMRmk)  \n\n### **Template Description**  \nThis n8n workflow empowers you to query structured financial data from Google Sheets or CSV files using AI-generated SQL. Unlike traditional vector database solutions that falter with numerical queries, this template leverages PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and an AI agent to dynamically create optimized SQL queries from natural language inputs.\n\n#### **What It Does**  \n- Retrieves data from Google Sheets or CSV files  \n- Infers the data schema and builds a PostgreSQL table  \n- Populates the table with your data  \n- Uses an AI agent to translate natural language questions into SQL queries  \n- Returns precise numerical results quickly and efficiently  \n\n#### **Why Use This?**  \n- No SQL knowledge required—the AI generates queries for you  \n- Bypasses the inefficiencies and costs of vector database approaches  \n- Scales effortlessly without overwhelming the language model  \n- Fully free and open-source  \n\n---\n\n### **Setup Requirements**  \n\n#### **Pre-Conditions**  \n- **PostgreSQL Database**: A running PostgreSQL instance (no specific extensions required beyond standard installation).  \n- **Google Sheets Access**: A publicly accessible or shared Google Sheet URL with structured data (e.g., financial records). Need a starting point? Use this [Sample Google Sheet Template](insert-link-here).  \n- **n8n Instance**: A working n8n setup with access to the Google Drive and PostgreSQL nodes.  \n\n#### **Step-by-Step Instructions**  \n1. **Add Your Google Sheets URL**  \n   - Open the \"Google Drive Trigger\" node.  \n   - Replace the placeholder URL with your Google Sheet’s link.  \n   - Verify the sheet name matches your data source.  \n\n2. **Configure PostgreSQL**  \n   - Update the \"PostgreSQL\" nodes with your database credentials (host, database, user, password).  \n   - The workflow automatically creates and populates the table based on your data schema.  \n\n3. **Run the Workflow**  \n   - Execute the workflow manually to set up the database.  \n   - Once initialized, use the AI agent by asking questions like:  \n     - _\"How much did I sell last week?\"_  \n     - _\"What were the total sales for Product X in February?\"_  \n\n4. **(Optional) Automate Updates**  \n   - Add a \"Schedule Trigger\" node to sync your Google Sheets data with PostgreSQL on a regular basis.  \n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**  \n- **Schema Detection**: The workflow analyzes your Google Sheets or CSV data to infer its structure and create an appropriate PostgreSQL table.  \n- **AI-Powered Queries**: An optimized AI agent converts your natural language questions into precise SQL queries, ensuring accurate results.  \n- **Efficient Retrieval**: By using PostgreSQL instead of vector-based methods, this template avoids common pitfalls like slow performance or inaccurate numerical outputs.  \n\n---\n\n### **Tips for Success**  \n- Ensure your Google Sheet or CSV has consistent column headers for smooth schema detection.  \n- Test with simple questions first to verify the AI agent’s query generation.  \n- Check out the [n8n Template Submission Guidelines](insert-link-here) for more best practices.

This helps reduce dependencies required for document parsing workflows where tools like StirlingPDF.\n\nRead the official documentation on Mistral OCR API here: [https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/document/#tag/ocr/operation/ocr_v1_ocr_post](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/document/#tag/ocr/operation/ocr_v1_ocr_post)\n\n## How it works\n* To access Mistral-OCR, you'll need to use Mistral Cloud API via the HTTP request node\n* Mistral OCR can only accept 2 file types: PDF and Image. Here, we use 2 different request to the Mistral-OCR API to parse a bank statement PDF and an screenshot of a bank statement to extract the tables.\n* Next, we explore a more secure method of uploading documents to the Mistral OCR API by using Mistral's cloud storage. In example 2, we first store a copy of our documents to Mistral cloud and then generate a signed URL to retreive the file before sending it to Mistral OCR. This ensures the file is not accessible publicly and protects it from unauthorised access.\n* Finally, another way to use Mistral-OCR is via document understanding. This allows you to ask questions about the document rather than extract contents from it. In example 3, I demonstrate this use-case asking Mistral-small to tell me how many deposits are shown in the bank statement.\n\n## How to use\n* Ensure your documents are either publicly accessible for Mistral-OCR or upload them to Mistral Cloud. Alternatively, signed urls from AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2 should also work.\n\n## Requirements\n* Mistral Cloud account and API  Key. You'll also need credit on your account to use Mistral-OCR.\n\n## Customising the workflow\n* Mistral-OCR also works for images such as charts and diagrams so try using it on Financial Reports.\n* Mistral-OCR is even cheaper with batching enabled. This returns your results within 24hrs but is half the price per page.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":21,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":10},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Jimleuk","username":"jimleuk","bio":"Freelance consultant based in the UK specialising in AI-powered automations.

Questions are asked in sequence from left column to right column.\n* When the user answers the question, a text classifier node is used to determine \nif a follow-up question could be asked.\n* If so, a mini conversation is initiated by the AI agent to get more details.\n* If not, the survey proceeds to the next question.\n* All answers and mini-conversations are recorded in the Google Sheet under the respective question.\n* When all questions are answered, the template will stop the survey and give the user a chance to restart.\n\n## How to use\n* You'll need to setup a Telegram bot ([see docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/telegram/))\n* Create a google sheet with an ID column. Populate the rest of the columns with your survey questions ([see sample](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQWcREg75CzbZd8loVI12s-DzSTj3NE_02cOCpAh7umj0urazzYCfzPpYvvh7jqICWZteDTALzBO46i/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true))\n* Ensure you have a Redis instance to capture state. Either self-host or sign-up to [Upstash](https://upstash.com?ref=jimleuk) for a free account.\n* Update the \"Set Variable\" node with your google sheet ID and survey title.\n* Share your bot to allow others to participate in your survey.\n\n## Requirements\n* Telegram for Chatbot\n* Google Sheets for Survey questions and answers\n* Redis for State Management and Chat Memory\n* Community+ license and above for Execution data node - you can remove this node if you don't have this licence.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* Not using Telegram? This template technically works with other chat apps such as Whatsapp, wechat and even n8n's hosted chat!\n* This state management pattern can also be applied to other use-cases and scenarios.

To change this:\n\nOpen the Trigger Node in n8n.\n\nModify the Cron Expression or select a different frequency (e.g., hourly, weekly, or custom intervals).\n\n2️⃣ Selecting **Specific Workflows** to Backup\n\nInstead of backing up all workflows, you can filter which ones to include:\n\nAdd a Filter Node before exporting data.\n\nDefine specific workflow IDs or names to include in the backup.\n\n3️⃣ Changing the Backup **Destination**\n\nThe default destination is Google Drive, but you can change this:\n\nReplace the Google Drive Node with a different storage provider (e.g., Dropbox, AWS S3, or local storage via FTP/SFTP).\n\nConfigure authentication for the new destination.\n\n4️⃣ Modifying Data Format\n\nBy default, the workflow stores data in JSON format. If you need a different format:\n\nConvert JSON to CSV using the Spreadsheet File Node.\n\nStore backups in a compressed format (ZIP) by adding a Compression Node.\n\n5️⃣ **Encrypting** the Backup for Extra Security\n\nFor added protection:\n\nUse the Crypto Node to encrypt the JSON file before uploading.\n\nSet up an Access-Controlled Folder in Google Drive with limited permissions.\n\n\n\n## ✅ Verify That Your Backup Works\n\nBefore relying on this workflow for your automated backups, make sure it works correctly by performing a quick test:\n\t1.\tManually trigger the workflow in n8n and check if the backup file appears in your Google Drive.\n\t2.\tOpen Google Drive, navigate to the backup folder, and download the JSON file.\n\t3.\tVerify its content by checking if the data matches your workflow’s execution logs.\n\t4.\tTry to import the JSON file back into n8n using the “Import File” function to ensure the workflow structure is intact.\n\t5.\tAlternatively, copy and paste a test file into Google Drive and confirm that it appears correctly in your workflow logs.\n\nThis quick test will confirm that your backup is running smoothly and that your data is retrievable whenever needed.\n\n## 📁 How to Find Your Google Drive Directory ID\nTo ensure that the backup is uploaded to the correct folder, you need to retrieve your Google Drive Directory ID. Follow these simple steps:\n\n1. Open Google Drive.\n2. Navigate to the folder where you want to store your backups.\n3. Click on the folder and check the URL in your browser.\n4. The Directory ID is the long string of characters at the end of the URL after /folders/.\n\n**Example:** 📌 If your folder URL is:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14oUlH_LW_NT0Xb2woZWvuzRncV-bhla\nThen, your Directory ID is:\n\n14oUlH_LW_NT0Xb2woZWvuzRncV-bhla\nCopy this Directory ID and use it in the workflow's parameters to ensure the backup is saved in the correct location.","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":6,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.n8n":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"phil","username":"phil","bio":"Accélérateur de Chiffre d'Affaires : Automatisez votre entreprise pour la rendre plus visible sur Google, pour trouver de nouveaux Clients, pour gagner du temps","verified":true,"links":["https://inforeole.fr"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e3fa7358cdb3b5be9c63e79d3d76a9a3f31efed6ea3611ec7bc18c0f34464d16?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":3112,"template_name":"Backup n8n Workflows to Google Drive","unique_visitors":323,"unique_weekly_visitors":0,"unique_monthly_visitors":321,"unique_inserters":99,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":99},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/3121","wf_detais":{"id":3121,"name":"AI-Powered Short-Form Video Generator with OpenAI, Flux, Kling, and ElevenLabs","createdAt":"2025-03-10T10:25:20.937Z","description":"## Who is this for?\nContent creators, digital marketers, and social media managers who want to automate the creation of short-form videos for platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels without extensive video editing skills.\n## What problem does this workflow solve?\nCreating engaging short-form videos consistently is time-consuming and requires multiple tools and skills.

If none, it might mean the user needs a reminder to follow-up.\n* For leads applicable for follow-up, we first get an AI Agent to find available meeting slots in the calendar.\n* These slots and reminder are sent to the user via send-and-approval mode of the gmail node. The user replies in natural language either picking a slot, suggesting an entirely new slot or declines the request.\n* When accepted, another AI Agent books the meeting in the calendar with the proposed dates and lead.\n* When declined, no action is taken.\n\n## How to use\n* Update all calendar nodes (+subnodes) to point to the right calendar. If this is a shared-purpose calendar, you may need to either filter or create a new calendar.\n* Update the gmail nodes to point to the right accounts.\n\n## Requirements\n* Google OAuth for Email and Calendar\n* OpenAI for LLM\n\n## Customising the template\n* Not using Google?

Ensure you have [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed and running locally\n2. Pull the required models mentioned in the workflow using Ollama CLI (e.g., `ollama pull phi4`)\n3. Configure the Ollama API credentials in n8n (default: http://127.0.0.1:11434)\n4. Activate the workflow and start interacting through the chat interface\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n- Add or remove models from the router's decision framework based on your specific Ollama collection\n- Adjust the system prompts in the LLM Router to prioritize different model selection criteria\n- Modify the decision tree logic to better suit your specific use cases\n- Add additional preprocessing steps for specialized inputs\n\n\nThis workflow demonstrates how n8n can be used to create sophisticated AI orchestration systems that respect user privacy by keeping everything local while still providing intelligent model selection capabilities.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":16,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":9},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOllama":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Joseph LePage","username":"joe","bio":"As an AI Automation consultant based in Canada, I partner with forward-thinking organizations to implement AI solutions that streamline operations and drive growth.","verified":true,"links":[""],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e7ca218dfc87b68344bbd66f40da01546d2f6fc1cf884267821e8a77e3e8410a?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":3139,"template_name":"🔐🦙Private & Local Ollama Self-Hosted + Dynamic LLM Router","unique_visitors":1646,"unique_weekly_visitors":3,"unique_monthly_visitors":1644,"unique_inserters":504,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":504},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/3141","wf_detais":{"id":3141,"name":"Send n8n Error Reports to LINE","createdAt":"2025-03-12T06:35:11.585Z","description":"This workflow template, \"n8n Error Report to LINE,\" is designed to streamline error handling by sending real-time notifications to your LINE account whenever an error occurs in any of your n8n workflows.

This workflow automates the process by detecting images in a specific Google Drive folder, matching them with corresponding product records in Odoo, and updating the product images accordingly. It ensures that Odoo’s product catalog always has the latest images without manual work.\n\n## How it works  \n- **Find Files**: Scans a designated Google Drive folder for images.  \n- **Filter Images**: Identifies files that are either `.jpg` or `.png`.  \n- **Validate Naming Convention**: Ensures that images follow the required naming format:  \n  - `template_{sku}.png` or `template_{sku}.jpg` for product templates.  \n  - `product_{sku}.png` or `product_{sku}.jpg` for individual products.  \n- **Extract Metadata**: Parses the file name to retrieve model and SKU information.  \n- **Match with Odoo**: Searches for corresponding product templates or product records in Odoo based on SKU.  \n- **Download Images**: Retrieves images from Google Drive.  \n- **Convert to Base64**: Encodes images for Odoo compatibility.  \n- **Update Odoo**: Updates product images across multiple resolutions in Odoo.  \n- **Cleanup**: Moves processed images to a \"done\" folder or deletes them.  \n- **Announce Completion**: Sends a notification via Google Chat with the summary of updated images.  \n- **Scheduled Execution**: Runs automatically every 30 minutes or can be triggered manually.\n\n## Set up steps  \n1. **Ensure images are correctly named** following the format:  \n   - `template_{sku}.png` or `template_{sku}.jpg` (for product templates).  \n   - `product_{sku}.png` or `product_{sku}.jpg` (for individual products).  \n2. **Configure Google Drive credentials** in n8n.  \n3. **Configure Odoo credentials** with API access.  \n4. **Set the correct folder IDs** for input and processed images.  \n5. **Enable the scheduler** to automate the process at regular intervals.  \n6. **Test manually** before deployment.\n","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":19,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.odoo":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.summarize":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleChat":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"AArtIntelligent","username":"aurelien-andre","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[""],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/53bbb31798713703b0b6ba058a7160cb4f9f6413d66f9463c8e0398119e36b8f?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":3181,"template_name":"Import Odoo Product Images from Google Drive","unique_visitors":289,"unique_weekly_visitors":2,"unique_monthly_visitors":287,"unique_inserters":27,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":27},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/3184","wf_detais":{"id":3184,"name":"🚀 Process YouTube Transcripts with Apify, OpenAI & Pinecone Database","createdAt":"2025-03-16T18:15:06.954Z","description":"# 🚀 YouTube Transcript Indexing Backend for Pinecone 🎥💾\n\nThis tutorial explains how to build the **backend** workflow in n8n that indexes YouTube video transcripts into a Pinecone vector database. **Note:** This workflow handles the processing and indexing of transcripts only—the retrieval agent (which searches these embeddings) is implemented separately.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Workflow Overview\n\nThis backend workflow performs the following tasks:\n\n1. **Fetch Video Records from Airtable** 📥  \n   Retrieves video URLs and related metadata.\n\n2. **Scrape YouTube Transcripts Using Apify** 🎬  \n   Triggers an Apify actor to scrape transcripts with timestamps from each video.\n\n3. **Update Airtable with Transcript Data** 🔄  \n   Stores the fetched transcript JSON back in Airtable linked via video ID.\n\n4. **Process & Chunk Transcripts** ✂️  \n   Parses the transcript JSON, converts \"mm:ss\" timestamps to seconds, and groups entries into meaningful chunks. Each chunk is enriched with metadata—such as video title, description, start/end timestamps, and a direct URL linking to that video moment.\n\n5. **Generate Embeddings & Index in Pinecone** 💾  \n   Uses OpenAI to create vector embeddings for each transcript chunk and indexes them in Pinecone. This enables efficient semantic searches later by a separate retrieval agent.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Step-by-Step Guide\n\n### Step 1: Retrieve Video Records from Airtable 📥\n\n- **Airtable Search Node:**  \n  - **Setup:** Configure the node to fetch video records (with essential fields like `url` and metadata) from your Airtable base.\n  \n- **Loop Over Items:**  \n  - Use a **SplitInBatches** node to process each video record individually.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Scrape YouTube Transcripts Using Apify 🎬\n\n- **Trigger Apify Actor:**  \n  - **HTTP Request Node (\"Apify NinjaPost\"):**  \n    - **Method:** POST  \n    - **Endpoint:** `https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/topaz_sharingan~youtube-transcript-scraper-1/runs?token=&lt;YOUR_TOKEN&gt;`  \n    - **Payload Example:**\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"includeTimestamps\": \"Yes\",\n        \"startUrls\": [\"{{ $json.url }}\"]\n      }\n      ```\n  - **Purpose:** Initiates transcript scraping for each video URL.\n\n- **Wait for Processing:**  \n  - **Wait Node:**  \n    - **Duration:** Approximately 1 minute to allow Apify to generate the transcript.\n\n- **Retrieve Transcript Data:**  \n  - **HTTP Request Node (\"Get JSON TS\"):**  \n    - **Method:** GET  \n    - **Endpoint:** `https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/topaz_sharingan~youtube-transcript-scraper-1/runs/last/dataset/items?token=&lt;YOUR_TOKEN&gt;`\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Update Airtable with Transcript Data 🔄\n\n- **Format Transcript Data:**  \n  - **Code Node (\"Code\"):**  \n    - **Task:** Convert the fetched transcript JSON into a formatted string.\n      ```javascript\n      const jsonObject = items[0].json;\n      const jsonString = JSON.stringify(jsonObject, null, 2);\n      return { json: { stringifiedJson: jsonString } };\n      ```\n      \n- **Extract the Video ID:**  \n  - **Set Node (\"Edit Fields\"):**  \n    - **Expression:**  \n      ```javascript\n      {{$json.url.split('v=')[1].split('&')[0]}}\n      ```\n      \n- **Update Airtable Record:**  \n  - **Airtable Update Node (\"Airtable1\"):**  \n    - **Updates:**  \n      - **ts:** Stores the transcript string.  \n      - **videoid:** Uses the extracted video ID to match the record.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Process Transcripts into Semantic Chunks ✂️\n\n- **Retrieve Updated Records:**  \n  - **Airtable Search Node (\"Airtable2\"):**  \n    - **Purpose:** Fetch records that now contain transcript data.\n\n- **Parse and Chunk Transcripts:**  \n  - **Code Node (\"Code4\"):**  \n    - **Functionality:**  \n      - Parses transcript JSON.\n      - Converts \"mm:ss\" timestamps to seconds.\n      - Groups transcript entries into chunks based on a 3-second gap.\n      - Creates an object for each chunk that includes:\n        - **Text:** The transcript segment.\n        - **Video Metadata:** Video ID, title, description, published date, thumbnail.\n        - **Chunk Details:** Start and end timestamps.\n        - **Direct URL:** A link to the exact moment in the video (e.g., `https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID&t=XXs`).\n\n- **Enrich & Split Text:**  \n  - **Default Data Loader Node:**  \n    - Attaches additional metadata (e.g., video title, description) to each chunk.\n  - **Recursive Character Text Splitter Node:**  \n    - **Settings:** Typically set to 500-character chunks with a 50-character overlap.\n    - **Purpose:** Ensures long transcript texts are broken into manageable segments for embedding.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Generate Embeddings & Index in Pinecone 💾\n\n- **Generate Embeddings:**  \n  - **Embeddings OpenAI Node:**  \n    - **Task:** Convert each transcript chunk into a vector embedding.\n    - **Tip:** Adjust the batch size (e.g., 512) based on your data volume.\n\n- **Index in Pinecone:**  \n  - **Pinecone Vector Store Node:**  \n    - **Configuration:**  \n      - **Index:** Specify your Pinecone index (e.g., `\"videos\"`).  \n      - **Namespace:** Use a dedicated namespace (e.g., `\"transcripts\"`).\n    - **Outcome:** Each enriched transcript chunk is stored in Pinecone, ready for semantic retrieval by a separate retrieval agent.\n\n---\n\n## 🎉 Final Thoughts\n\nThis backend workflow is dedicated to processing and indexing YouTube video transcripts so that a separate retrieval agent can perform efficient semantic searches. With this setup:\n\n- **Transcripts Are Indexed:**  \n  Chunks of transcripts are enriched with metadata and stored as vector embeddings.\n\n- **Instant Topic Retrieval:**  \n  A retrieval agent (implemented separately) can later query Pinecone to find the exact moment in a video where a topic is discussed, thanks to the direct URL and metadata stored with each chunk.\n\n- **Scalable & Modular:**  \n  The separation between indexing and retrieval allows for easy updates and scalability.\n\nHappy automating and enjoy building powerful search capabilities with your YouTube content! 🎉","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":16,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.airtable":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStorePinecone":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Adyl Itto ","username":"adyl","bio":"I’m an automation enthusiast transforming complex processes into streamlined workflows with tools like n8n, Airtable, Apify, and Pinecone.

It checks the file type against allowed types, organizes files into date-based folders and (optionally) file type–specific subfolders, and sends a reply message back to the LINE user with the file URL or an error message if the file type is not permitted.\n\n## Who is this for?\n**Developers & IT Administrators:** Looking to integrate LINE with Google Drive and Sheets for automated file management.\n**Businesses & Marketing Teams:** That want to automatically archive media files and documents received from users via LINE.\n**Anyone Interested in No-Code Automation:** Users who want to leverage n8n’s capabilities without heavy coding.\n\n## What Problem Does This Workflow Solve?\n**Automated File Organization:** Files received from LINE are automatically checked for allowed file types, then stored in a structured folder hierarchy in Google Drive (by date and/or file type).\n**Data Logging:** Each file upload is recorded in a Google Sheet, providing an audit trail with file names, upload dates, URLs, and types.\n**Instant Feedback:** Users receive an immediate reply via LINE confirming the file upload, or an error message if the file type is not allowed.\n## What This Workflow Does\n**1. Receives Incoming Requests:**\n* A webhook node (*\"LINE Webhook Listener\"*) listens for POST requests from LINE, capturing file upload events and associated metadata.\n\n**2. Configuration Loading:**\n* A Google Sheets node (*\"Get Config\"*) reads configuration data (e.g., parent folder ID, allowed file types, folder organization settings, and credentials) from a pre-defined sheet.\n\n**Data Merging & Processing:**\n* The *\"Merge Event and Config Data\"* and *\"Process Event and Config Data\"* nodes merge and structure the event data with configuration settings.\n* A *\"Determine Folder Info\"* node calculates folder names based on the configuration. If Store by Date is enabled, it uses the current date (or a specified date) as the folder name. If Store by File Type is also enabled, it uses the file’s type (e.g., image) for a subfolder.\n\n**4. Folder Search & Creation:**\n* The workflow searches for an existing date folder (*\"Search Date Folder\"*).\n* If the date folder is not found, an IF node (*\"Check Existing Date Folder\"*) routes to a *\"Create Date Folder\"* node.\n* Similarly, for file type organization, the workflow uses a *\"Search FileType Folder\"* node (with appropriate conditions) to look for a subfolder, or creates it if not found.\n* The *\"Set Date Folder ID\"* and *\"Set Image Folder ID\"* nodes capture and merge the resulting folder IDs.\n* Finally, the *\"Config final ParentId\"* node sets the final target folder ID based on the configuration conditions:\n  - **Store by Date: TRUE, Store by File Type: TRUE:** Use the file type folder (inside the date folder).\n  - **Store by Date: TRUE, Store by File Type: FALSE:** Use the date folder.\n  - **Store by Date: FALSE, Store by File Type: TRUE:** Use the file type folder.\n  - **Store by Date: FALSE, Store by File Type: FALSE:** Use the Parent Folder ID from the configuration.\n\n**5. File Retrieval and Validation:**\n- A HTTP Request node (*\"Get File Binary Content\"*) fetches the file’s binary data from the LINE API.\n- A Function node (*\"Validate File Type\"*) checks if the file’s MIME type is included in the allowed list (e.g., \"audio|image|video\"). If not, it throws an error that is captured for the reply.\n\n**6. File Upload and Logging:**\n- The *\"Upload File to Google Drive\"* node uploads the validated binary file to the final target folder.\n- After a successful upload, the *\"Log File Details to Google Sheet\"* node logs details such as file name, upload date, Google Drive URL, and file type into a designated Google Sheet.\n\n**7. User Feedback:**\n- The *\"Check Reply Enabled Flag\"* node checks if the reply feature is enabled.\n- Finally, the *\"Send LINE Reply Message\"* node sends a reply message back to the LINE user with either the file URL (if the upload was successful) or an error message (if the file type was not allowed).\n\n## Setup Instructions\n**1. Google Sheets Setup:**\n* **Create a Google Sheet with two sheets:**\n  - **config:** Include columns for Parent Folder Path, Parent Folder ID, Store by Date (boolean), Store by File Type (boolean), Allow File Types (e.g., “audio|image|video”), CurrentDate, Reply Enabled, and CHANNEL ACCESS TOKEN.\n  - **fileList:** Create headers for File Name, Date Uploaded, Google Drive URL, and File Type.\n\nFor an example of the required format, check this Google Sheets template: [Google Sheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iO4ZHU7s0fe1Jn8jcScNDce7rFXQlkRBqsO8IFHbcSc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n**2. Google Drive Credentials:**\n- Set up and authorize your Google Drive credentials in n8n.\n\n**3. LINE Messaging API:**\n* Configure your LINE Developer Console webhook to point to the n8n Webhook URL (\"Line Chat Bot\" node).\n* Ensure you have the proper Channel Access Token stored in your Google Sheet.\n\n**4. n8n Workflow Import:**\n* Import the provided JSON file into your n8n instance.\n* Verify node connections and update any credential references as needed.\n\n**5. Test the Workflow:**\n* Send a test message via LINE to confirm that files are properly validated, uploaded, logged, and that reply messages are sent.\n\n## How to Customize This Workflow\n* Allowed File Types: Adjust the *\"Validate File Type\"* field in your config sheet to control which file types are accepted.\n* Folder Structure: Modify the logic in the \"Determine Folder Info\" and subsequent folder nodes to change how folders are structured (e.g., use different date formats or add additional categorization).\n* Logging: Update the *\"Log File Details to Google Sheet\"* node if you wish to log additional file metadata.\n* Reply Messages: Customize the reply text in the *\"Send LINE Reply Message\"* node to include more detailed information or instructions.","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":27,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Jaruphat J.","username":"jaruphatj","bio":"Project Manager who passionate about Automation & AI and continuously explore innovative ways to improve business processes through intelligent workflow automation.

Do you find yourself looking through the many titles of videos uploaded to Youtube, just to find the ones you want to watch?  Even when you subscribe to the channels you like, do you find that you want to watch the news now and my tech/n8n videos later?  Well, now you can have n8n grab the last 8 videos, posted in the last 24 hours, and put them in a playlist for the day; and, each day the old playlist is deleted.\n\n   Are you tired of a channel filling your subscriptions with tons of videos a day; this workflow can be used for any channel, whether you are subscribed to the channel or not.  It's a YouTube playlist automation.\n\n## How it works:\n  - Create your list of prefered Youtube Channels in a Google Sheet and it will create you a daily playlist; and, it will delete the playlist created yesterday.\n\n## Instructions\n1. To set this up, you need to create a Google Sheet with the following headings in line 1:\n\n   Channel User Name\n   Channel Name\n   Channel Link\n   Channel ID\n\n2. Copy the 'Create your Channel List' into it's own workflow and link the Sheets links to your new sheet.\n\n3. To get the 'Create your Channel List' to work, you need to visit each channel's page that you want included in your playlist; you need to get the \"@\" name of the channel and add it to the 'Channel User Name' column of your Google Sheet.\n\n   For example: if you wanted to include this channel: Recruit Training Videos - Corporal Stock, you would search for the name, to add to the next available row of the 'Channel User Name' column: @CorporalStock\n\n4.

It integrates **Google Drive**, **Pinecone**, and a Chat AI agent (using Google Gemini/OpenRouter) to transform static support documents into an interactive, searchable knowledge base. With two interlinked workflows—one for processing support documents and one for handling chat queries—employees receive fast, context-aware answers directly from your support documentation.\n\n## Overview\n\n### Document Ingestion Workflow\n- **Google Drive Trigger:** Monitors a specified folder for new file uploads (e.g., updated support documents).\n- **File Download & Extraction:** Automatically downloads new files and extracts text content.\n- **Data Cleaning & Text Splitting:** Utilizes a Code node to remove line breaks, trim extra spaces, and strip special characters, while a text splitter segments the content into manageable chunks.\n- **Embedding & Storage:** Generates text embeddings using Google Gemini and stores them in a Pinecone vector store for rapid similarity search.\n\n### Chat Query Workflow\n- **Chat Trigger:** Initiates when an employee sends a support query.\n- **Vector Search & Context Retrieval:** Retrieves the top relevant document segments from Pinecone based on similarity scores.\n- **Prompt Construction:** A Code node combines the retrieved document snippets with the user’s query into a detailed prompt.\n- **AI Agent Response:** The constructed prompt is sent to an AI agent (using OpenRouter Chat Model) to generate a clear, step-by-step solution.\n\n## Key Benefits & Use Case\n\nImagine a large organization where every IT support document—from troubleshooting guides to system configurations—is stored in a single Google Drive folder. When an employee encounters an issue (e.g., “How do I reset my VPN credentials?”), they simply type the query into a chat interface. Instantly, the workflow retrieves the most relevant context from the ingested documents and provides a detailed, actionable answer.

The endpoint used in this workflow does *not* require an API key.\n2. Add your desired alert mechanism in the red box attached to the `New breach` node.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n- **Modify Notification Settings**: Tailor where alerts are sent (email, Slack, etc.). Add the desired node after the `New breach` node. This node contains all the data from the breach so it is eaisily available.\nYou can choose from a variety of n8n nodes to send alerts when a new breach is detected. Below are a few common options you might consider adding after the New breach node:\n\n1. **Email Node**\nWhat it does: Sends an email notification to one or more recipients.\nUse case: Great for simple alerts to your inbox or a team distribution list.\nCustomization: You can include breach details in the subject or body of the email, using data from the New breach node.\n2. **Slack Node**\nWhat it does: Sends a message to a Slack channel or user.\nUse case: Perfect for real-time alerts to your team in Slack.\nCustomization: You can post breach details directly in a channel or DM. You can also format the message (bold, code blocks, etc.).\n3. **Microsoft Teams Node**\nWhat it does: Sends a message to a Teams channel.\nUse case: For organizations that use Microsoft Teams for communication.\nCustomization: Similar to Slack, you can customize the message content and include all relevant breach information.\n4. **Discord Node**\nWhat it does: Sends an alert message to a Discord channel.\nUse case: Useful for teams or communities that coordinate via Discord.\nCustomization: Add formatted messages with breach details for easy viewing.\n5. **Telegram Node**\nWhat it does: Sends messages to a Telegram chat or group.\nUse case: Good for mobile notifications and fast alerts.\nCustomization: You can include breach summaries or detailed information, and even use bots to automate this.\n6. **Webhook Node** (as a sender)\nWhat it does: Sends breach data to another service via a webhook.\nUse case: If you have an external system or app that handles alerts, you can push the data directly to it.\nCustomization: Send JSON payloads with detailed breach information to trigger actions in other systems.\n7. **SMS Nodes** (like Twilio)\nWhat it does: Sends an SMS notification to one or more phone numbers.\nUse case: For urgent alerts that need to be seen immediately.\nCustomization: Keep messages concise, including key breach details like the time, type of breach, and affected system.\n- **Adjust Check Frequency**: Change the interval in the Schedule Trigger node (e.g., hourly or daily).","categories":[{"id":13,"name":"Support"},{"id":29,"name":"SecOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":24,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.convertToFile":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Audun","username":"xqus","bio":"Transforming complexity into simplicity.","verified":true,"links":["https://xqus.com"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/273c8f67ecb3e3ea711c36a448f1fd547ca9ad698ae800bebd69be68317f63d1?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":3205,"template_name":"Monitor Data Breaches in Real-time with Have I Been Pwned","unique_visitors":476,"unique_weekly_visitors":1,"unique_monthly_visitors":475,"unique_inserters":136,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":136},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/3211","wf_detais":{"id":3211,"name":"Chinese Translator via Line x OpenRouter (Text & Image) ","createdAt":"2025-03-18T17:36:10.863Z","description":"This workflow template, \"Chinese Translator via Line x OpenRouter (Text & Image)\" is designed to provide seamless Chinese translation services directly within the LINE messaging platform.

No need to check your feed again: no email = no new video.\n### Example email\n![YouTube n8n.png](fileId:1027)\n\n## How it works\nEvery hour (by default), we:\n- Fetch all your YouTube subscriptions from the YouTube Data v3 API.\n- Get a list of the latest videos of each channel through RSS (we don't use YouTube's API for this step as it would put us over the daily quota).\n- Send you a simple yet beautiful email for each new video that was published since the last run of the workflow. To go to the video, simply click on the thumbnail.\n### Caveats\nBecause of the way this workflow is implemented, if your n8n instance stops, you will not get emails for the videos you missed when your instance is back online.\nThe situation could be improved if n8n gave us an easy way to access the last successful execution's timestamp.\n\n## Set up instructions\n1. Complete the `Set up credentials` step when you first open the workflow. You'll need YouTube OAuth2 API and SMTP credentials.\n2. In the `Send an email for each new video` step, set the email address from which the email will be sent (an email address that your SMTP credentials allow sending from) and the email address to which you are going to send the email to (can be the same).\n### Optional steps\n3. From the `Schedule Trigger` step, you can change the check frequency (default: every hour).\n4. If there are channels that you do not want notifications from, you can add their channel ID to the list in the `Filter out channels` step.\nTo get a channel's ID, go to its main page, click on the description, then \"Share channel\" and finally \"Copy channel ID\".\n5.

By simply sending the command /brave followed by a query, the workflow retrieves search results from Brave and returns them as a Telegram message.\n\nThis workflow is ideal for users who want a quick and private way to search the web without switching between apps. 🚀\n\nThis workflow is a powerful tool for automating interactions with Brave tools through Telegram, providing users with quick and easy access to information directly in their chat.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the workflow:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. How It Works**\nThe workflow is designed to process user queries from Telegram, execute a Brave tool via the MCP Client, and send the results back to the user. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Telegram Trigger**:\n   - The workflow starts with the **Telegram Trigger** node, which listens for new messages in a Telegram chat.\n   - When a message is received, the workflow checks if it starts with the command `/brave`.\n\n2. **Filter Messages**:\n   - The **If** node filters messages that start with `/brave`. If the message doesn't start with `/brave`, the workflow stops.\n\n3. **Edit Fields**:\n   - The **Edit Fields** node extracts the text of the message for further processing.\n\n4. **Clean Query**:\n   - The **Clean Query** node removes the `/brave` command from the message, leaving only the user's query.\n\n5. **List Brave Tools**:\n   - The **List Brave Tools** node retrieves the list of available tools from the MCP Client.\n\n6. **Execute Brave Tool**:\n   - The **Exec Brave Tool** node executes the first tool in the list using the cleaned query as input.\n\n7. **Send Message**:\n   - The **Send Message** node sends the result of the Brave tool execution back to the user in the Telegram chat.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Preliminary Steps**\n- Access to an n8n self-hosted instance and install the Community node \"n8n-nodes-mcp\". Please see this [easy guide](https://github.com/nerding-io/n8n-nodes-mcp)\n- Get your Brave Search API Key: https://brave.com/search/api/\n- Telegram Bot Access Token\n\nIn \"List Brave Tools\" create new credential as shown in  this image\n![image](https://github.com/nerding-io/n8n-nodes-mcp/raw/main/assets/credentials-envs.png)\n\nIn Environment field set this value:\nBRAVE_API_KEY=your-api-key\n\n---\n\n\n#### **3. Set Up Steps**\nTo set up and use this workflow in n8n, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Telegram Configuration**:\n   - Set up **Telegram** credentials in n8n for the **Telegram Trigger** and **Send Message** nodes.\n   - Ensure the Telegram bot is authorized to read messages and send responses in the chat.\n\n2. **MCP Client Configuration**:\n   - Set up **MCP Client** credentials in n8n for the **List Brave Tools** and **Exec Brave Tool** nodes.\n   - Ensure the MCP Client is configured to interact with Brave tools.\n\n3. **Test the Workflow**:\n   - Send a message starting with `/brave` followed by a query (e.g., `/brave search for AI tools`) to the Telegram chat.\n   - The workflow will:\n     - Process the query.\n     - Execute the Brave tool via the MCP Client.\n     - Send the result back to the Telegram chat.\n\n4. **Optional Customization**:\n   - Modify the workflow to include additional features, such as:\n     - Adding more commands or tools.\n     - Integrating with other APIs or services for advanced use cases.\n     - Sending notifications via other channels (e.g., email, Slack).","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":14,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-mcp.mcpClient":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.telegramTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Davide","username":"n3witalia","bio":"Full-stack Web Developer based in Italy specialising in Marketing & AI-powered automations.

It retrieves image URLs from a **Google Sheet**, converts the images, and uploads the converted files to **Google Drive**. \n\nThis workflow is a powerful tool for automating image conversion tasks, saving time and ensuring that images are efficiently converted and stored in the desired format.\n\nUsing WebP images on a website provides several SEO benefits:  \n\n1. **Faster Loading Speed** – WebP files are smaller than JPG and PNG, reducing page load times and improving user experience.  \n2. **Better Core Web Vitals** – Google prioritizes websites with good performance metrics like LCP (Largest Contentful Paint).  \n3. **Improved Mobile Performance** – Smaller images consume less bandwidth, enhancing mobile usability.  \n4. **Higher Search Rankings** – Faster sites tend to rank better on Google due to improved user experience.  \n5. **Reduced Server Load** – Lighter images lower hosting and CDN costs while improving site efficiency.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the workflow:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. How It Works**\nThe workflow is designed to convert images from JPG/PNG to WEBP format and manage the converted files. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Manual Trigger**:\n   - The workflow starts with a **Manual Trigger** node, which initiates the process when the user clicks \"Test workflow.\"\n\n2. **Set API Key**:\n   - The **Set API KEY** node defines the API key required to access the APYHub API.\n\n3. **Get Images**:\n   - The **Get Images** node retrieves a list of image URLs from a **Google Sheet**. The sheet contains columns for the original image URL (`FROM`), the converted image URL (`TO`), and a status flag (`DONE`).\n\n4. **Get Extension**:\n   - The **Get Extension** node extracts the file extension (JPG, JPEG, or PNG) from the image URL and adds it to the JSON data.\n\n5. **Determine Image Type**:\n   - The **JPG or PNG?** node checks the file extension and routes the workflow to the appropriate conversion node:\n     - **JPG/JPEG**: Routes to the **From JPG to WEBP** node.\n     - **PNG**: Routes to the **PNG to WEBP** node.\n\n6. **Convert Image**:\n   - The **From JPG to WEBP** and **PNG to WEBP** nodes send POST requests to the **APYHub API** to convert the images to WEBP format.\n   - The API returns the URL of the converted image.\n\n7. **Update Google Sheet**:\n   - The **Update Sheet** node updates the Google Sheet with the URL of the converted image and marks the row as done (`DONE`).\n\n8. **Get Converted Image**:\n   - The **Get File Image** node downloads the converted WEBP image from the URL provided by the APYHub API.\n\n9. **Upload to Google Drive**:\n   - The **Upload Image** node uploads the converted WEBP image to a specified folder in **Google Drive**.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Set Up Steps**\nTo set up and use this workflow in n8n, follow these steps:\n\n1. **APYHub API Key**:\n   - Obtain an **API Key** from [APYHub](https://apyhub.com/).\n   - In the **Set API KEY** node, define the API key.\n\n2. **Google Sheets Integration**:\n   - Set up **Google Sheets** credentials in n8n for the **Get Images** and **Update Sheet** nodes.\n   - Create a Google Sheet with columns for `FROM` (original image URL), `TO` (converted image URL), and `DONE` (status flag).\n   - Provide the **Document ID** and **Sheet Name** in the **Get Images** node.\n\n3. **Google Drive Integration**:\n   - Set up **Google Drive** credentials in n8n for the **Upload Image** node.\n   - Specify the folder ID in Google Drive where the converted images will be uploaded.\n\n4. **Test the Workflow**:\n   - Click the **\"Test workflow\"** button in n8n to trigger the workflow.\n   - The workflow will:\n     - Retrieve image URLs from the Google Sheet.\n     - Convert the images to WEBP format using the APYHub API.\n     - Update the Google Sheet with the converted image URLs.\n     - Upload the converted images to Google Drive.\n\n5. **Optional Customization**:\n   - Modify the workflow to include additional features, such as:\n     - Adding more image formats for conversion.\n     - Sending notifications when the conversion is complete.\n     - Integrating with other storage services (e.g., Dropbox, AWS S3).\n","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"},{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":12,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Davide","username":"n3witalia","bio":"Full-stack Web Developer based in Italy specialising in Marketing & AI-powered automations.

Well, now you can! This n8n template shows how you can build a very capable Youtube search engine powered by Apify, Qdrant and your LLM of choice to quickly and efficiently browse over many videos for research.\n\nI originally started to template to ask questions on the \"n8n @ scale office-hours\" livestream videos but then extended it to include the latest videos on the official channel.\n\n**Check out a demo here**: [https://jimleuk.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/n8n_videos](https://jimleuk.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/n8n_videos)\n\n## How it works\n* Stage 1 is to collect the Youtube video transcripts and push them into a vector database. For this, I've used Apify to scrape Youtube and Qdrant to store the embeddings.\n* Transcripts are broken down into smaller chunks and carefully tagged with metadata to assist in later search and filtering.\n* Stage 2 is to build a web frontend for the user to query the vectorised transcripts. I'm using a webhook to serve a simple web app and API to dynamically fetch the results.\n* When searching for a video, I've opted to use Qdrant's search groups API which in this use-case, performs better as it returns a wider range of videos results.\n* In the web frontend, when the user clicks on the results, the matching Youtube video plays in an embedded video player.\n\n## How to use\n* Once credentials are all set, first run steps 1 - 3 to populate your vector store.\n* Next, set the workflow to active to expose the web frontend. Visit the webhook URL in your browser to use it.\n* If only for personal use, you may want to remove the rate limiting mechanism in step 4.\n\n## Requirements\n* Apify for Youtube Channel and Video Scraping\n* Qdrant for Vector store\n* OpenAI for LLM and Embeddings\n\n## Customising the template\n* Not interested in official n8n videos? Swap to a different channel - this template will work on many as long as videos are not private or set to prevent embeds.\n* Technically any vector store should work but may not have the same grouping API. Use the simple vector store node and revert back to basic searching instead.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":62,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":9},"n8n-nodes-base.html":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.sort":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.redis":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.markdown":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":13},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.removeDuplicates":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":5},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStoreQdrant":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.informationExtractor":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Jimleuk","username":"jimleuk","bio":"Freelance consultant based in the UK specialising in AI-powered automations.

Since Shopify requires a [Fulfillment Order ID](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2025-01/resources/fulfillmentorder#get-orders-order-id-fulfillment-orders) (not [Order ID](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2025-01/resources/order#get-orders-order-id?fields=id,line-items,name,total-price)) to trigger fulfillment, the workflow follows these steps:\n\n1️⃣ Get all unfulfilled orders using the Shopify node.\n2️⃣ Retrieve the Fulfillment Order ID using the \"List Fulfillment Orders\" action.\n3️⃣ Create a fulfillment request using \"Mark fulfillment order as fulfilled.\"\n4️⃣ Handle edge cases, such as partially fulfilled orders or API errors.\n\nThis ensures that every valid order is marked as fulfilled efficiently.\n🔗 Ongoing discussions on this topic: [Relevant Shopify API Discussion](https://community.shopify.com/c/shopify-flow-app/how-can-i-use-flow-to-automatically-fulfil-one-product/m-p/2209832)\n\n## Step-by-step\nThe workflow can be run as requested or on schedule\n\nYou can adjust these parameters within the Shopify and filter nodes:\n\n**Shopify Admin URL** – A Global node to customize the Shopify store URL.\n - To find your Shopify store ID, login into your Shopify admin, then look at the URL in your browser's address bar, the subdomain portion (e.g., `example_store_id.myshopify.com`) is your store ID (in this case: `example_store_id`)\n\n**Order Filtering** – Ensures only valid orders are fulfilled, particularly useful if:\n\n- You sell digital downloads or gift cards exclusively.\n- You use third-party fulfillment services for all products.\n\n## Credentials\nTo run this workflow, you'll need:\n\n- Shopify API Key – Required for authentication.\n\n## Who Is This For?\nShopify store owners looking to automate their fulfillment process.\n\nMerchants selling digital or personalized products who need instant fulfillment.\n\n---\nExplore More Templates  \n👉 [Check out my other n8n templates](https://n8n.io/creators/bangank36/)\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":13,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.shopify":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"bangank36","username":"bangank36","bio":"Automation specialist with 10+ years of experience helping SME website owners streamline their workflows—specializing in Squarespace, Shopify, and WordPress.

It converts the content of an email and its attachments (PDF or Word documents) into an AI-written article/blog post. \n\n## What does it do?\nThis workflow assists editors and journalists in managing incoming press-releases from governments, companies, NGOs, or individuals. The result is a draft article that can easily be reviewed by the editor, who receives it in a reply email containing both the original input and the output, plus an AI-generated self-assessment. This self-assessment represents an additional feedback loop where the AI compares the input with the output to evaluate the quality and accuracy of its transformation.\n\n## How does it work?\nTriggered by incoming emails in Google, it first filters attachments, retaining only Word and PDF files while removing other formats like JPGs. The workflow then follows one of three paths:\n\n    - If no attachments remain, it processes the inline email message directly.\n    - For PDF attachments, it uses an extractor to obtain the document content.\n    - For Word attachments, it extracts the text content by a http request.\n\nIn each case, the extracted content is then passed to an AI agent that converts the press release into a well-structured article according to predefined prompts. A separate AI evaluation step provides a self-assessment by comparing the output with the original input to ensure quality and accuracy. Finally, the workflow generates a reply email to the sender containing three components: the original input, the AI-generated article, and the self-assessment. This streamlined process helps editors and journalists efficiently manage incoming press releases, delivering draft articles that require minimal additional editing.\"  \n\n## How to set it up\n### 1. Configure Gmail Connection: \n- Create or use an existing Gmail address\n- Connect it through the n8n credentials manager\n- Configure polling frequency according to your needs\n- Set the trigger event to \"Message Received\"\n        Optional: Filter incoming emails by specifying authorized senders\n- Enable the \"Download Attachments\" option\n\n### 2. Set Up AI Integration:\n- Create an OpenAI account if you don't have one\n- Create a new AI assistant or use an existing one\n- Customize the assistant with specific instructions, style guidelines, or response templates\n- Configure your API credentials in n8n to enable the connection\n\n### 3. Configure Google Drive Integration:\n- Connect your Google Drive credentials in n8n\n- Set the operation mode to \"Upload\"\n- Configure the input data field name as \"data\"\n-Set the file naming format to dynamic: {{ $json.fileName }}\n\n### 4. Configure HTTP Request Node:\n- Set request method to \"POST\"\n- Enter the appropriate Google API endpoint URL\n- Include all required authorization headers\n- Structure the request body according to API specifications\n- Ensure proper error handling for API responses\n\n### 5. Configure HTTP Request Node 2:\n\n- Set request method to \"GET\"\n- Enter the appropriate Google API endpoint URL\n- Include all required authorization headers\n- Configure query parameters as needed\n- Implement response validation and error handling\n\n\n\n### 6.  Configure Self-Assessment Node:\n\n- Set operation to \"Message a Model\"\n- Select an appropriate AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)\n- Configure the following prompt in the Message field:\n\n\n\nPlease analyze and compare the following input and output content:\n\n(for example)\n\nOriginal Input:\n{{ $('HTTP Request3').item.json.data }}\n{{ $('Gmail Trigger').item.json.text }}\n\nGenerated Output:\n{{ $json.output }}\n\nProvide a detailed self-assessment that evaluates:\n1. Content accuracy and completeness\n2. Structure and readability improvements\n3. Tone and style appropriateness\n4. Any information that may have been omitted or misrepresented\n5. Overall quality of the transformation\n\n### 7. Configure Reply Email Node:\n\n- Set operation to \"Send\" and select your Gmail account\n- Configure the \"To\" field to respond to the original sender: {{ $('Gmail Trigger').item.json.from }}\n- Set an appropriate subject line: RE: {{ $('Gmail Trigger').item.json.subject }}\n- Structure the email body with clear sections using the following template:\n\nhandlebars\n\n***EDITED ARTICLE***   \n\n{{ $('AI Article Writer 2').item.json.output }}\n\n***SELF-ASSESSMENT***\nRating: 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)\n{{ $json.message.content }}\n\n***ORIGINAL MESSAGE***\n\n{{ $('Gmail Trigger').item.json.text }}\n\n***ATTACHMENT CONTENT***\n\n{{ $('HTTP Request3').item.json.data }}\n\n    Note: Adjust the template fields according to the input source (PDF, Word document, or inline message).

I’m Samir, a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist from Paris, founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com) 🌱\n\nA significant improvement in my productivity came from following the **Pomodoro Technique**.\n\n### What is the Pomodoro Technique?  \nThe Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks your workday into 25-minute focus intervals followed by short breaks. After 4 cycles, you take a longer break to recharge.  \nIt helps maintain concentration while preventing burnout.\n\n![Explaination](https://runmefit.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/How-the-Pomodoro-Technique-Works.jpg)\n\nI’ve used this technique with web apps to receive break/work notifications. But I always wished I had a way to **track my sessions** for self-assessment.\n\n&gt; Let’s use **n8n** to boost our productivity and log our deep work sessions automatically!\n\n### Who Is This Template For?  \nI built this workflow for creators, freelancers, students, and professionals who love the Pomodoro technique but want more than just timers — they want data.\n\nThis template helps you:\n- Track every deep work session automatically\n- Store logs in Google Sheets for later analysis\n- Stay in control via Telegram commands  \n\nThere is no need to pay for premium apps. It’s all **free** and powered by **n8n**.\n\n### How Does It Work?  \nThis Telegram bot tracks your Pomodoro sessions and sends you alerts during the process.\n\n**Here’s what happens:**\n\n1.

It addresses a significant limitation of n8n's native GitHub node, which only supports single-file uploads at a time. By leveraging GitHub's Git Data API, this workflow creates a new Git tree containing multiple files, commits this tree, and updates the target branch—all in a single automated process.\n\nThe workflow is particularly valuable for automation scenarios that require batch file operations, such as deploying website updates, publishing documentation, or maintaining configuration files across repositories. It eliminates the need for multiple separate API calls when working with multiple files, making your automation more efficient and less prone to partial update issues.\n\nBy abstracting the complexities of GitHub's Git Data API into a reusable workflow, it provides a practical solution for developers, content managers, and DevOps professionals who need to programmatically manage repository content at scale.\n\n## Who is this for?\nThis workflow is designed for:\n\n- Developers and DevOps engineers who need to automate file updates in GitHub repositories\n- Content managers who regularly publish multiple files to GitHub-hosted websites or documentation\n- Automation specialists looking to integrate GitHub operations into larger workflows\n- Teams using n8n for CI/CD processes who need to push code or configuration changes\n\nUsers should have basic familiarity with GitHub concepts (repositories, branches, commits) and should be comfortable obtaining and using GitHub Personal Access Tokens. While the workflow handles the API complexity, users should understand the fundamentals of version control to effectively utilize and customize it.\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving?\nThis workflow addresses several key challenges:\n\n1. **Limited batch operations**: n8n's native GitHub node only supports uploading one file at a time, making multi-file operations cumbersome and inefficient.\n\n2. **API complexity**: GitHub's Git Data API requires multiple sequential calls with interdependent data to create commits with multiple files, which is complex to implement manually.\n\n3. **Automation bottlenecks**: Without this workflow, automating multi-file updates would require either multiple separate API calls (risking partial updates) or custom scripting outside of n8n.\n\n4. **Consistency issues**: When files need to be updated together (e.g., code and corresponding documentation), this workflow ensures they're committed in a single atomic operation.\n\nBy solving these issues, the workflow enables reliable, atomic updates of multiple files, maintaining repository consistency and simplifying automation processes.\n\n## What this workflow does\n### Overview\nThis workflow uses GitHub's REST API to push multiple files to a repository in a single operation. It follows Git's internal model by:\n1. Retrieving the current state of the repository\n2. Creating a new tree with the files to be added or updated\n3. Creating a new commit with this tree\n4. Updating the branch reference to point to the new commit\n\n### Process\n1. **Initialization**: The workflow starts with a manual trigger and sets up GitHub credentials and repository information.\n\n2. **File Content Definition**: Two \"Set\" nodes define the content for the files to be uploaded.\n\n3. **Repository State Retrieval**: \n   - The workflow fetches the latest commit SHA for the specified branch\n   - It then retrieves the base tree SHA from this commit\n\n4. **Tree Creation**: A new Git tree is created that includes both files (file1.txt and file2.txt), specifying their paths and content.\n\n5. **Commit Creation**: A new commit is created with the specified commit message, referencing the new tree and the parent commit.\n\n6. **Branch Update**: Finally, the branch reference is updated to point to the new commit, making the changes visible in the repository.\n\n## Setup\nTo use this workflow:\n\n1. **Import the workflow**: Download the workflow JSON and import it into your n8n instance.\n\n2. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token**:\n   - Go to GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Fine-grained tokens\n   - Create a new token with \"Contents\" permission (Read and write) for your target repository\n\n3. **Configure the workflow**:\n   - Update the \"Set Github Info\" node with:\n     - Your GitHub Personal Access Token\n     - Your GitHub username\n     - Your repository name\n     - The target branch (default is \"main\")\n     - A commit message\n\n4. **Define file content**:\n   - Modify the \"File 1\" and \"File 2\" nodes with the content you want to upload\n\n5. **Adjust file paths if needed**:\n   - In the \"Create new tree\" node, update the file paths if you want to change where the files are stored in the repository\n\n6. **Save and run the workflow**: Click \"Test workflow\" to execute the process.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\nThis workflow can be adapted in several ways:\n\n1. **Add more files**: \n   - Create additional \"Set\" nodes for more file content\n   - In the \"Create new tree\" node, add more tree entries following the same pattern (path, mode, type, content)\n\n2. **Change file locations**:\n   - Modify the \"path\" parameters in the \"Create new tree\" node to place files in different directories\n\n3. **Dynamic file content**:\n   - Replace the static content in the \"File\" nodes with data from other sources\n   - Use previous nodes or HTTP requests to generate file content dynamically\n\n4. **Conditional file updates**:\n   - Add IF nodes to determine which files should be updated based on certain conditions\n   - Create separate branches in your workflow for different update scenarios\n\n5. **Scheduled updates**:\n   - Replace the manual trigger with a Schedule node to run the workflow at specific intervals\n   - Combine with other triggers like Webhook or database events to push files when certain events occur\n\n6. **Error handling**:\n   - Add Error Trigger nodes to handle potential API failures\n   - Implement notification nodes to alert you of successful pushes or failures","categories":[{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":10,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Custom Workflows AI","username":"customworkflowsai","bio":"We specializes in crafting tailored automation solutions that help businesses streamline their operations and boost productivity.

Simply typing the name of an item you wish to purchase into a chat message will initiate the workflow to begin its search process to identify 5 top of the line products for you to purchase. The initial chat with prompt the Item Finder AI agent utilizing the power of GPT-4o in combination with SerpAPI to conduct a search and find 5 top end items that match the prompt. It will then send the name of each item to a separate Reviewer Tools Agent that will gather information on each item. Each Reviewer Tools Agent will again harness the power of GPT-4o and SerpAPI to give a detailed description of the item features, lowest price available, options of retailers available to purchase the item, a summary of the reviews and overall star ratings. \n# Who This Is For\nThis is the perfect workflow for anyone who is interested in making a big-time purchase and wants to have all the information presented in a quick organized fashion to make the best decision possible. Rather than searching through multiple stores and reading through hundreds of reviews and product description, you can now utilize the power of GPT-4o and SerpAPI to conduct that search for you and bring all the information to you. Whether you are searching for a TV with the best screen quality, a work laptop that will have the power and memory you need, or that unique item for your business that is difficult to find and even harder to find the cheapest price, this workflow is exactly what you need.\n# How It Works\nBegin by opening the chat trigger node and typing the name of an item you would like to purchase and would like it to do an in-depth search for. Example: golf driver, gaming desktop computer, or mid-size three row SUV.\nThis will trigger the Item Finder Tools Agent to begin to utilize GPT-4o to begin to create search queries based off the item you wish to purchase. It will then use these search queries with SerpAPI to identify 5 high quality, modern items. After it has obtained the names of five items it will then in a structured output, send each item to a separate Reviewer Tools Agent.\nOnce the Reviewer Tools Agent has received the name of the item it will then begin an in-depth review of that item. Each Reviewer Tools Agent will again use the power of GPT-4o connected with SerpAPI to obtain the most up to date information on each item from the internet. For each item you will be provided with:\n- Detailed description of item features\n\t-  It will go in depth and give features that make that item unique. Qualities that will allow you to compare one items features to another.\n- Lowest Price available\n- Online retail stores available for purchase\n- Summary of reviews\n\t- It will give both the pros and cons discussed by various reviewers in regard to the item.\n- Overall star rating\nAfter each of the Reviewer Tools Agent is complete with its review of the item, they will all send the information along to a Compiler Tools Agent.  This tools agent uses GPT-4o-mini to arrange the data and present it in a concise, organized fashion. This allows for easy readability.\n# Set Up Steps\nSet up steps:\n1. You will need to obtain an Open AI API key from platform.openai.com/api-keys\n2. After you obtain this Open AI API key you will need to connect it to the Open AI Chat Model for all of the Tools agents (Item finder, Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2, Reviewer 3, Reviewer 4, Reviewer 5, and Compiler).\n3. You will now need to fund your Open AI account. GPT 4o costs ~$0.06 to run the workflow.\n4. Next you will need to create a SerpAPI account at https://serpapi.com/users/sign_up\n5. After you create an account you will need to obtain a SerpAPI key.\n6. You will then need to use this key to connect to the SerpAPI tool for each of the tools agents (Item finder, Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2, Reviewer 3, Reviewer 4, and Reviewer 5)\n\t- Tip: SerpAPI will allow you to run 100 free searches each month. This workflow uses ~8-15 SerpAPI searches per run. If you would like to utilize the workflow more than that each month, create multiple SerpAPI accounts and have an API key for each account. When you utilize all 100 free searches for an account, switch to the API key for another account within the workflow.\n ","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":26,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":7},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolSerpApi":{"count":6},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":7},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserStructured":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"AiAgent","username":"lifehacks","bio":"As a self-taught entrepreneur, I’m passionate about automating everyday tasks to simplify life.

Instead of manually visiting each URL, taking a screenshot, and organizing the results, this workflow automates everything. When a spreadsheet is added to a designated Google Drive folder, the template extracts URLs from the column named \"Url.\" These URLs are then processed through ScreenshotOne to capture screenshots, which are saved back to the same folder. Finally, an email notification is sent via Gmail with a link to the folder containing the screenshots.\n\n## Problem Solved\nThis template addresses the challenge of manual screenshot capture for multiple URLs. Without this automation, a user would need to:\n\n- Open each URL from a spreadsheet.\n- Take a screenshot manually.\n- Save each screenshot with an appropriate name.\n- Organize the screenshots in a folder.\n- Notify stakeholders when the process is complete.\n\nThese steps are not only time-consuming but also repetitive, especially when handling a large number of URLs.\n\n### Who Can Benefit:\n- **Digital Marketers:** Monitor website appearances for competitive analysis or to track campaign landing pages.\n- **Web Developers/Designers:** Capture screenshots of multiple websites for inspiration or reference.\n- **QA Teams:** Document the visual state of web pages during various stages of development.\n- **SEO Specialists:** Track visual changes to websites they are optimizing.\n- **Content Managers:** Monitor how content appears across various web properties.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- **Google Drive Node:** Must have appropriate permissions to create and access folders.\n- **Connected Google Sheets Node:** To extract URLs from the spreadsheet.\n- **Authenticated Gmail Node:** For sending notifications.\n- **ScreenshotOne Account:** Either a free or paid plan depending on volume needs, along with an **[Access key](https://dash.screenshotone.com/access)**.  \n  *Ensure you replace the placeholder `--YOUR ACCESS KEY--` with your generated access key in the \"Get Screenshots\" node.*\n\n## Workflow Details\n### Step 1: Google Drive Integration\n- **Trigger Node:**  \n  Monitors a specific folder in Google Drive. When a spreadsheet is added, the workflow is initiated.  \n\n### Step 2: Google Sheets Processing\n- **Google Sheets Node:**  \n  Extracts URLs from the column named \"Url.\"\n\n### Step 3: Screenshot Capture\n- **Get Screenshots Node:**  \n  Sends each extracted URL to ScreenshotOne to capture screenshots.\n\n### Step 4: Saving Screenshots and Notifications\n- **Google Drive Node:**  \n  Saves the captured screenshots back into the same folder.\n- **Gmail Node:**  \n  Sends an email notification with a link to the folder, alerting stakeholders that the screenshots are ready.\n\n## Customization Guidance\n- ### Folder Monitoring:\n\tThe workflow is set to monitor a specific Google Drive folder. It can be customized by selecting a different folder in the node settings.\n\n- ### Spreadsheet Structure:\n\tWhile the template expects a spreadsheet with a column named \"Url.\" for extracting URLs, users can add additional columns (e.g., titles, categories, or tags) and modify the workflow to utilize them as needed.\n\n- ### Email Settings:\n\tCustomize the recipient, subject, and body of the notification email to suit your needs. If required, enable optional notifications for different stakeholders.\n\n- ### ScreenshotOne Access Key & Configurations:\n\tA valid ScreenshotOne **[Access key](https://dash.screenshotone.com/access)** is required to capture screenshots. Users can further refine screenshot settings (e.g., viewport size, device emulation, or delay timing) by exploring the available options in the **[ScreenshotOne API documentation](https://dash.screenshotone.com/playground)**.","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":9,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDriveTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Niko","username":"niko","bio":"Software / Automation Engineer, dedicated to crafting efficient and elegant solutions.

If the file is not listed in DB, i supposed it's new one.\n\n### Way #1 - We get all files from the monitored folder\n1. I set a variable `folder_to_watch` to indicate which folder to monitor. This step is here just to be homogeneous and allow setting the folder path only once in this branch.\n2. I list the folder files\n3. We keep only files (exclude folders)\n4. Then I call the specialized sub-workflow\n\n### Way #2 - We want only new files from the monitored folder\n1. I set a variable `folder_to_watch` to indicate which folder to monitor \n2. I list the folder files and keep only files\n3. Meanwhile, I query my DB to get known files about this folder (I send the query to NocoDB `(folder_to_watch,eq,{{ $json.folder_to_watch }})`)\n4.

Additionally, managing files, background music, and updating statuses manually can be tedious and prone to errors.\n\n## What this workflow does\n- Automatically fetches background video and music files stored on Google Drive.\n\n- Randomly selects a quote (demonstrated with Thai language) and author information from Google Sheets.\n\n- Dynamically combines the selected quote and author text using appealing fonts, such as the Thai font \"Kanit,\" directly onto the video using FFmpeg on your n8n local environment.\n\n- Creates visually engaging videos with a 9:16 aspect ratio, optimized for YouTube Shorts and other vertical video platforms.\n\n- Automatically uploads the finalized video to YouTube.\n\n- Updates the status and YouTube URL back into your Google Sheet, ensuring you have up-to-date records.\n\n## Setup\n### Requirements:\nThis workflow requires a **self-hosted n8n instance**, as the execution of FFmpeg commands is not supported on n8n Cloud. Ensure FFmpeg is installed on your self-hosted environment.\n\n### Google Sheets Setup:\nYour Google Sheet must include at least these columns:\n\n- Index: (Unique identifier for each quote)\n- Quote: (Text of the quote)\n- Author: (Author of the quote)\n- CreateStatus: (Track video creation status; values like 'DONE' or blank for pending)\n- YoutubeURL: (Automatically updated after upload)\n\nTo help you get started quickly, you can use [this template spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/184-zcrfWSzQpDa-t57Oo_8DLyAF-2B_6yvGrybrcd5I/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n### Next steps:\n\n1. Organize your video and music files in separate folders in Google Drive.\n2. Authenticate your Google Sheets, Google Drive, and YouTube accounts in n8n.\n3. Ensure fonts compatible with your target languages (such as Kanit for Thai) are available in your FFmpeg installation.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- **Fonts:** Adjust font styles and sizes within the workflow's code node. Ensure the fonts you choose fully support the language you wish to use.\n\n- **Quote Management:** Easily add or remove quotes and authors in your Google Sheets document.\n\n- **Media Files:** Change or update background videos and music by modifying the files in your Google Drive folders.\n\n- **Video Specifications:** Customize video dimensions, text positioning, opacity, and music volume directly in the provided FFmpeg commands.\n\n## Benefits of Using Localized Fonts and Quotes\n\nUtilizing fonts specific to your target language, as demonstrated with Thai, significantly increases audience engagement by making your content more relatable, shareable, and visually appealing.

API Key Configuration**  \n- Under **\"Credentials\"**, add your **OpenAI API key** from your OpenAI account settings.  \n- This key is used to generate the LinkedIn Boolean search string.  \n\n### **2. Adjust Search Parameters**  \n- Navigate to the **\"If\" node** and update the condition to define the **desired number of LinkedIn profiles** to extract.  \n- The **default is 50**, but you can set it to any number based on your needs.  \n\n### **3. Establish Google Sheets Connection**  \n- **Connect your Google Sheets account** to the workflow.  \n- **Create a document** to store the sourced LinkedIn profiles.  \n- The workflow **automatically creates a new sheet** for each new search, so no manual setup is needed.  \n\n### **4. Authenticate Google Search**  \n- **Google search requires authentication** for better results.  \n- Use the **Cookie-Editor browser extension** to **export your header string** and enable authenticated Google searches within the workflow.  \n\n### **5. Run the Workflow**  \n- **Execute** the workflow and monitor the **Google Sheet** for newly added LinkedIn profiles.  \n\n---\n\n## **Benefits:**  \n✅ **Automates profile sourcing**, reducing manual search time.  \n✅ **Generates precise LinkedIn Boolean search strings** tailored to job descriptions.  \n✅ **Extracts and saves LinkedIn profiles efficiently** for recruitment efforts.  \n\nThis solution leverages **OpenAI and advanced search techniques** to enhance your **talent sourcing process**, making it faster and more accurate! 🚀\n","categories":[{"id":17,"name":"HR"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":18,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":3},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Abdullah Maftah","username":"abdullah","bio":"I save talent acquisition professionals and 360 recruiters valuable time by automating candidate sourcing, screening, and outreach.
