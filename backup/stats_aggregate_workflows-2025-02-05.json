spreadsheet.\n\n![workflow-screenshot](fileId:468)\n\n**Set node:** The Set node is used to generate data that we want to add to Google Sheets. Depending on your use-case you might have data coming from a different source. For example, you might be fetching data from a WebHook call. Add the node that will fetch the data that you want to add to the Google Sheet.\nUse can then use the Set node to set the data that you want to add to the Google Sheets.\n\n**Google Sheets node:** This node will add the data from the Set node in a new row to the Google Sheet. You will have to enter the Spreadsheet ID and the Range to specify which sheet you want to add the data to.\n\n**Google Sheets1 node:** This node looks for a specific value in the Google Sheet and returns all the rows that contain the value. In this example, we are looking for the value Berlin in our Google Sheet. If you want to look for a different value, enter that value in the ***Lookup Value*** field, and specify the column in the ***Lookup Column*** field.\n\n**Set1 node:** The Set node sets the value of the rent by $100 for the houses in Berlin. We pass this new data to the next nodes in the workflow.\n\n**Google Sheets2 node:** This node will update the rent for the houses in Berlin with the new rent set in the previous node. We are mapping the rows with their ID. Depending on your use-case, you might want to map the values with a different column. To set this enter the column name in the ***Key*** field.\n\n**Google Sheets3 node:** This node returns the information from the Google Sheet. You can specify the columns that should get returned in the ***Range*** field. Currently, the node fetches the data for columns A to D. To fetch the data only for columns A to C set the range to `A:C`.\n\nThis workflow can be broken down into different workflows each with its own use case. For example, we can have a workflow that appends new data to a Google Sheet, and another workflow that lookups for a certain value and returns that value.\n\nYou can learn to build this workflow on the documentation page of the [Google Sheets](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets/#google-sheets) node.","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"ghagrawal17","username":"harshil1712","bio":null,"verified":true,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/1060ec3113fdd8cafb191f3728c0ac39436b3cd46be4dd518923e242fb708ef1?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":694,"template_name":"Transform data in Google Sheets","unique_visitors":869,"unique_weekly_visitors":14,"unique_monthly_visitors":20,"unique_inserters":103,"unique_weekly_inserters":3,"unique_monthly_inserters":4},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/695","wf_detais":{"id":695,"name":"Get local datetime into Function node using moment.js","createdAt":"2020-10-01T17:03:43.754Z","description":"![workflow-screenshot](fileId:260)\n\nA quick example showing how to get the local date and time into a Function node using moment.js.\n\nThis relies on the `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable being correctly configured (see the docs [here](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/configuration.html#timezone))\n\n**NOTE**: In order for this to work, you must whitelist the moment library for use by setting the following environment variable:\n\n```bash\nNODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL=moment\n```\n\nFor convenience, the Function code is as follows:\n\n```javascript\nconst moment = require('moment');\n\nlet date = moment().tz($env['GENERIC_TIMEZONE']);\n\nlet year = date.year();\nlet month = date.month(); // zero-indexed!\nlet day = date.date();\nlet hour = date.hours();\nlet minute = date.minutes();\nlet second = date.seconds();\nlet millisecond = date.millisecond();\nlet formatted = date.format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSS Z');\n\nreturn [\n  {\n    json: {\n      utc: date,\n      year: year,\n      month: month, // zero-indexed!\n      day: day,\n      hour: hour,\n      minute: minute,\n      second: second,\n      millisecond: millisecond,\n      formatted: formatted\n    }\n  }\n];\n```","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":2,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.function":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Trey","username":"trey","bio":null,"verified":true,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a34b927d14a6b3b96f3a6e588ee0fbfd519efd1c8cec0586b1a6e5976fc72d2a?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":695,"template_name":"Get local datetime into Function node using moment.js","unique_visitors":468,"unique_weekly_visitors":7,"unique_monthly_visitors":10,"unique_inserters":31,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":0},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/696","wf_detais":{"id":696,"name":"Send email via Gmail on workflow error","createdAt":"2020-10-01T18:53:44.644Z","description":"![workflow-screenshot](fileId:261)\n\nSend an email via Gmail when a workflow error occurs.\n\nThe email subject line will contain the workflow name; the message body will contain the following information:\n\n- Workflow name\n- Error message\n- Last node executed\n- Execution URL\n- Stacktrace\n\nError workflows do not need to be activated in order to be used, but they do need to be selected in the Settings menu of whatever workflows you want to use it.\n\nTo use this workflow, you'll need to:\n- Create and select credentials in the Gmail node\n- Choose the email recipient(s) in the Gmail node\n- Save and select the created workflow as the \"Error Workflow\" in the Settings menu of whatever workflows you want to email on error","categories":[{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":3,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.errorTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Trey","username":"trey","bio":null,"verified":true,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a34b927d14a6b3b96f3a6e588ee0fbfd519efd1c8cec0586b1a6e5976fc72d2a?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":696,"template_name":"Send email via Gmail on workflow error","unique_visitors":1203,"unique_weekly_visitors":17,"unique_monthly_visitors":25,"unique_inserters":424,"unique_weekly_inserters":2,"unique_monthly_inserters":2},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/697","wf_detais":{"id":697,"name":"Archive Spotify's discover weekly playlist","createdAt":"2020-10-02T01:29:47.308Z","description":"![workflow-screenshot](fileId:264)\n\nThis workflow will archive your Spotify Discover Weekly playlist to an archive playlist named \"Discover Weekly Archive\" **which you must create yourself**.

channel.\n\n![workflow-screenshot](fileId:346)\n\n**Typeform Trigger node:** Whenever a user submits a response to the Typeform, the Typeform Trigger node will trigger the workflow. The node returns the response that the user has submitted in the form.\n\n**Google Cloud Natural Language node:** This node analyses the sentiment of the response the user has provided and gives a score.\n\n**IF node:** The IF node uses the score provided by the Google Cloud Natural Language node and checks if the score is negative (smaller than 0). If the score is negative we get the result as True, otherwise False.\n\n**Mattermost node:** If the score is negative, the IF node returns true and the true branch of the IF node is executed. We connect the Mattermost node with the true branch of the IF node. Whenever the score of the sentiment analysis is negative, the node gets executed and a message is posted on a channel in Mattermost.\n\n**NoOp:** This node here is optional, as the absence of this node won't make a difference to the functioning of the workflow.\n\nThis workflow can be used by Product Managers to analyze the feedback of the product. The workflow can also be used by HR to analyze employee feedback. You can even use this node for sentiment analysis of Tweets.\n\nTo perform a sentiment analysis of Tweets, replace the Typeform Trigger node with the Twitter node.\n\n***Note:*** You will need a Trigger node or Start node to start the workflow.\n\nInstead of posting a message on Mattermost, you can save the results in a database or a Google Sheet, or Airtable. Replace the Mattermost node with (or add after the Mattermost node) the node of your choice to add the result to your database. \n\nYou can learn to build this workflow on the documentation page of

choosing).  These can then be shared through your entire org and used to track changes (if you make any sad 'oopsies'.\n\n## Flow\n\n1. Obtains and creates listing of currently configured workflows.\n2. Iterates through each workflow looking at the following\n\t1. Github source (if present)\n\t2. Actual workflow code (from N8N)\n3. Workflow code is sorted and compared for any changes\n4. If changed (or new) the workflows are saved / archived into github.\n\n## Configuration\n\nMost of the configuration is done in the `Globals` node which houses the repo detail for github nodes.  The only other dependency is that it by default looks for a `GitHub` credential, if you use something other than that precise wording you will need to change the credential used on the respective nodes.  We gave it 'Manage' rights, but that was only so that it was able to override a requirement for checks to complete?  Most would probably only need 'Write' privileges.\n\n## Background\n\nWell, so we initially started using N8N just as a kubernetes-based service housed with its DB running inside the pod.  Worked great for getting to know N8N and we jut kept all our workflows and credentials listed in a readme.  Fast forward about a year...\n\nWe have migrated this into our 'production' toolsets and maintain a bunch of team worflows inside it (not company-wide, but LOTS of team fun).  While trying to spin a copy of our production RDS database, the ++actual++ production database was deleted, and in doing so AWS was nice enough to wipe our snapshots too!! Yea!\n\nThankfully it only took us a few hours to get everything back up and running thanks to this, so I'm sharing it for everyone to benefit.

For example, a **Google Sheets** or **Airtable** sheet, a **.CSV** file, or any relational database like **MySQL**. \n\nGenerally, you need to ensure that you send well-formatted data into the Spreadsheet or Database node. You can use the [Set](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/#set) or [Function](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function/#function) node to transform data into the correct format for your destination.\n\n![key_to_table.png](fileId:435)\n\n## Key concepts\n- Spreadsheets and databases have columns, like \"Name\" and \"Email\". The data you send into a Spreadsheet/ Database node needs to match these column names for each row of data that you want to insert. Data points need to be represented as key-value pairs. Specifically, each item of data needs to have a JSON key for each column in the sheet. For a spreadsheet with \"Name\" and \"Email\" columns, it would look like: **{\"Name\" : \"Karla\", \"Email\" : \"karla@email.com\"}**\n\n- Before appending or inserting data to a spreadsheet or database, you might need to transform it into the correct format. You can preprocess the data with a [Set](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/#set) or [Function](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function/#function) node. The Set node allows you to perform simple transforms when the data you want to load into spreadsheet rows is already represented as items. Use the Function node when you need to map nested data (like arrays) inside a single item to their own top-level items ([Example in community forums](https://community.n8n.io/t/getting-all-items-from-trello-api-call/4567/8)).\n- Spreadsheet and database nodes in n8n perform their configured action (like **Append**, **Create Row**, **Write to File**) on each item of input data. \n\n\n\n## Workflow walkthrough\n\n[![homepage](https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/eb87068f35a14af095f7b0f020b62211-with-play.jpg)](https://www.loom.com/share/eb87068f35a14af095f7b0f020b62211)\n","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":4,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.function":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Max Tkacz","username":"maxt","bio":"Design @ n8n","verified":true,"links":["https://n8n.io"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/4eca9c29591ed5132a4c192e7447d9a42f5ae70f6ca2dbf89c15113e195a810b?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":980,"template_name":"Load data into spreadsheet or database","unique_visitors":1144,"unique_weekly_visitors":22,"unique_monthly_visitors":31,"unique_inserters":46,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":0},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/982","wf_detais":{"id":982,"name":"Gender inclusive language bot for Mattermost","createdAt":"2021-03-15T08:58:33.146Z","description":"This workflow ensures gender inclusive language in Mattermost channels.

In the example, it's the `.`, and the repository name is `repo`. Change it in the commands *and in the workflow commands* (you can set it as a variable in the wokflow). Checkout to another branch if you won't use the master one.\n\n```\ncd .\ngit clone repository\n```\n\nOr you could `git init` and then add the remote (`git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL`), whatever pleases you more.\n\nAs the server, check if everything is ok for beeing able to commit. Very likely you'll need to setup the user email and name. Try to create a commit, and push it to upstream, and everything you need (like config a user to comit) will appear in way. I strong suggest testing with exporting the commands to garantee it will work too.\n\n```\ncd ./repo\n\ngit commit -c \"Initial commmit\" --allow-empty\n```\n\n-u is the same as --set-upstream\n\n```sh \ngit push -u origin master \n```\n\nTesting to push to upstream with the first exported data\n\n```\nnpx n8n export:workflow --backup --output ./repo/workflows/\nnpx n8n export:credentials --backup --output repo/credentials/\n\ncd ./repo\ngit add .\ngit commit -c \"manual backup: first export\"\ngit push\n```\n\nAfter that, if everything is ok, the workflow should work just fine.\n\n## Adjustments\n\nAdjust the path in used in the workflow. See the the `git -C PATH` command is the same as `cd PATH; git ...`.\n\nAlso, adjust the cron to run as you need. As I said in the beginning, you can run it even for every minute, but it will create commits only when there are changes.\n\n### Credentials encryption\n\nThe default for exporting the credentials is to do them encrypted. You can add the flag `--decrypted` to the `n8n export:credentials` command if you need to save them in plain. But as general rule, it's better to save the encryption key, that you only need to do that once, and them export it safely encrypted.","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.cron":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand":{"count":5}}}},"user":{"name":"Allan Daemon","username":"allandaemon","bio":null,"verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/1687c83a4fb8808fac61e4c2caa35aeb9e7953516a53a3d4bbfb380b83c48291?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1053,"template_name":"Git backup of workflows and credentials","unique_visitors":1616,"unique_weekly_visitors":24,"unique_monthly_visitors":33,"unique_inserters":692,"unique_weekly_inserters":3,"unique_monthly_inserters":5},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1055","wf_detais":{"id":1055,"name":"Validate emails in a table using Mailcheck","createdAt":"2021-04-27T07:41:19.383Z","description":"This workflow allows you to validate emails stored in a table using the Mailcheck node.\n\n![workflow-screenshot](fileId:485)\n\n**Airtable node:** This node will list all the records from a table.

The workflow will save this song in a playlist called `June '24`. If this playlist does not exist, the workflow will create it for me.\n\n## ⚙ How it works\nEach 5 minutes, the workflow will start automatically. He will do 3 things :\n1. Get the last 10 songs you saved in the \"Liked song\" playlist (by clicking on the heart in the app) and save them in a NocoDB table (of course, the workflow avoid to create duplicates).\n2. Check if the monthly playlist is already created. Otherwise, the playlist is created. The created playlist is also saved in NocoDB to avoid any problems.\n3. Check if the monthly playlist contains all the song liked this month by getting them from NocoDB. If they are not present, add them one by one in the playlist.\n\nYou may have a question regarding the need of NocoDB. Over the last few weeks/months, I've had duplication problems in my playlists and some playlists have been created twice because Spotify wasn't returning all the information but only partial information.\nHaving the database means I don't have to rely on Spotify's data but on my own, which is accurate and represents reality.\n\n## 📝 Prerequisites\nYou need to have :\n- Spotify API keys, which you can obtain by creating a Spotify application here: [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).\n- Create a NocoDB API token\n\n## 📚 Instructions\n1. Follow the [instructions below](https://n8n.io/workflows/1074#instructions)\n2. Create your Spotify API credential\n3. Create your NocoDB credential\n4. Populate all Spotify nodes with your credentials\n5. Populate all Spotify nodes with your credentials\n6.

To do so: open the `Start download` node and edit the Credentials. \n\n![image.png](fileId:581)\n\nPerform the same operation choosing the new credentials also in node `Start download new token`.\nIn this automation we call transmission twice due to a security protocol in transmission system that prevents single click commands to be triggered, performing the request twice bypasses this security mechanism. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)\nWe use the `X-Transmission-Session-Id` provided by the first request to authenticate the second request.\n\n### Telegram\nIn order to make the workflow work as expected you must create a telegram bot and configure the nodes (`Torrent not found` and `Telegram1`) to send your message once the workflow is complete. \nHere's an easy guide to follow [https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/)\nIn those nodes you also should configure the Chat ID, you may use your telegram username or use a bot to retrieve your id.\nYou may chat with [useridinfobot](https://t.me/useridinfobot) that sends you your id.\n\n## Ok google automation\n\nSince right now we do not have a n8n client for mobile that can trigger automation using google assistant I decided to use an IFTTT automation to trigger the webhook.\n\nI connect my IFTTT account with google assistant and pick the trigger.\n`Say a phrase with a text ingredient` as in the picture below.\n\n![image.png](fileId:582)\n\nAnd configure the trigger this way.\n`scarica $` -&gt; `download $`\nor\n`metti in download $` -&gt; `put in download $`\n\nor some other trigger you may want.\n\n![image.png](fileId:580)\n\nThen configure your server to trigger the webhook of n8n.\n\n![image.png](fileId:579)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion we provide a fully working automation that integrates in n8n a node library and provides an easy trigger to perform a complex operation.\n\n### Security concern\nGiving the ability to trigger a download may be problematic for potential unwanted torrent malware download, so you may decide to authenticate the webhook request passing in the body another field with a shared token between the two endpoints.\n\nMoreover the `torrent-search-api` library and its dependencies have some vulnerability that you may want to avoid on your own media-center, this will hopefully be patched soon in a further release of the library.\n\nThis is just an interesting proof of concept.\n\n### Quality of the download\n\nYou may want to introduce another block between torrent search and webhook trigger to search for a movie based on the words detected by google assistant, sometimes it misinterprets something and you may end up downloading potential copyrighted material.\nPlease use this automation only for free and open source movies and music.\n\n\n","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":9,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.functionItem":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Danger","username":"dangerblack","bio":null,"verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/56c18ac3eda0e3a9c1981f99325738e5623c892837c0c5c14e9697209661f386?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1381,"template_name":"Search and download torrents using transmission-daemon","unique_visitors":571,"unique_weekly_visitors":1,"unique_monthly_visitors":2,"unique_inserters":79,"unique_weekly_inserters":2,"unique_monthly_inserters":2},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1387","wf_detais":{"id":1387,"name":"Send automated daily reminders on Telegram","createdAt":"2022-01-08T22:38:50.531Z","description":"A goal for 2022 is to write 1 thing I do each day.

Additionally I opted to include to change the colour of Philips Hue lamp located in my living room where my wife is currently working so she know's if she can interrupt me or not.\n\nMy calendar is built on the theory behind the [Diary Detox](https://diarydetox.com/) system and as such the Slack Status reflect the colours involved. This was achieved using the emote aliases for the relevant colour circles.\n\n![4DW Colours.png](fileId:602)\n\nThe Philips Hue lamp status is changed via the local API with Home Assistant. This is a very similiar process to controlling it with something like the Streamdeck, but the workflow calls the Webhook instead of the Streamdeck. This process can be found in lots of Youtube videos such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI328yziiZs).\n\nThis gives my wife a very quick and easy way to know if she can interrupt me in my office (when the lights are Green or Blue) or when I'm busy (Red).\n\n![RedGreenLight.png](fileId:603)\n\n**Please Note:** The above images are not intended to be an incentive to create your own Squid Games.\n\nAdditionally, when integrating Slack with N8N, there are 2 x APIs which can be used. Typically the Bot User OAuth Token is used, however in order for your Status to be updated, the **User OAuth Token** must be used with the *users.profile:read* and *users.profile:write* permissions enabled.\n\nFor clarity, I have removed the Webhooks from the Workflow as this would allow any person to control my lights. These can be inserted in the HTTP Request nodes. Each node responds to a different automation within the Home Assistant infrastructure.\n\n*Acknowledgement: I would also credit Jon (Discord) aka 8668 (Workflows) for writing the Function node which turns the ColorID into a named variable.*","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.function":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleCalendar":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleCalendarTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"TheUnknownEntity","username":"theunknownentity","bio":null,"verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/fdfd7bebdaab5d5e3fd667a7f543df5f191deef57cad901af3fbe6767da59ccd?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1420,"template_name":"Google Calendar to Slack Status and Philips Hue","unique_visitors":269,"unique_weekly_visitors":5,"unique_monthly_visitors":6,"unique_inserters":39,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":1},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1423","wf_detais":{"id":1423,"name":"Tiny Tiny RSS new stared article saved to wallabag ","createdAt":"2022-02-02T23:18:21.292Z","description":"Every 10 minutes check if a new article was stared, if so, save it in wallabag to read it later.","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":10,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.cron":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.function":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"dev","username":"tyjak","bio":null,"verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/c7e3da5f1b0460589c52e4275fd4435c03735c865e4141d98dbc49e3935f8e8e?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1423,"template_name":"Tiny Tiny RSS new stared article saved to wallabag ","unique_visitors":74,"unique_weekly_visitors":1,"unique_monthly_visitors":1,"unique_inserters":39,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":0},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1425","wf_detais":{"id":1425,"name":"Send a random recipe once a day to Telegram","createdAt":"2022-02-03T07:38:45.132Z","description":"This telegram bot is designed to send one random recipe a day. \n\nThis specific bot has filtered out only vegan recipes, so you can choose your diet type and send only recipes for a specific diet. \n\nWhat credentials you need:\n- Set up a [telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots).\n- Airtable for listing who has joined your bot.

In Syncro, in addition to setting up the appropriate notification to webhook, you will also need a script that closes the agent_offline_trigger alert and an automated remediation to trigger that script when the asset goes offline (the script is queued and run when the asset comes back online).\n\n&gt; This workflow is part of an MSP collection, The original can be found here: https://github.com/bionemesis/n8nsyncro","categories":[{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"},{"id":29,"name":"SecOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Jonathan","username":"jon-n8n","bio":null,"verified":true,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/5240094f838126182ceefb50ca4a3cf75cc7dc0808efd4b9920d792e41bfc45e?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1491,"template_name":"Triage alerts from Syncro and submit to OpsGenie","unique_visitors":191,"unique_weekly_visitors":5,"unique_monthly_visitors":5,"unique_inserters":64,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":1},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1492","wf_detais":{"id":1492,"name":"Update time-tracking projects based on Syncro status changes","createdAt":"2022-02-22T14:34:32.216Z","description":"This workflow is part of an MSP collection, which is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bionemesis/n8nsyncro).\n\nThis workflow archives or unarchives a Clockify projects, depending on a Syncro status.

Here are some quick tips for making changes to the form.\n\n### Webform Nodes\nThere are two nodes that control what you see in the form:\n- *Create Shopper Form* - displays the form and submits it to the correct webhook\n- *Create Response Page* - displays the results when the form is submitted\n\n### Editing the Webform\nThe easiest way that I have found to edit the webform is to:\n1. Open up the Set node (*Create Shopper Form* or *Create Response Page*) that contains the HTML you wish to edit.\n2. Copy the contents of the HTML value to your favourite HTML editor\n3. Make your changes\n4. Paste the updated HTML back into the Set node\n\n### Changing the Webhook URL the Webform Posts To\nIn order for the webform to work properly, do the following:\n1. Determine the Production URL for the *Submit Shopper* webhook node\n2. In the *Create Shopper Form* node, look for the following line in the HTML value:\n`form action=\"https://tephlon.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/submit-shopper\" method=\"POST\"`\n3. Replace `https://tephlon.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/submit-shopper` with your Production URL\n\n### Changing the Webform Image\nThe image that is in the webform is actually embedded in the HTML in each of the *Create Shopper Form* or *Create Response Page* Set nodes and can be modified from there using these steps:\n1. Open up the appropriate Set node\n2. In the HTML value, find the line that starts with `background-image:`. It will be followed by a long string that looks like random characters\n3. Using a tool like [Image to Base64 Converter](https://codebeautify.org/image-to-base64-converter), upload your image and generate a new CSS background source\n4. Replace the original `background-image:` line (including all the \"random\" characters) with the new generated CSS background source\n\n","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":14,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.cron":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.baserow":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.emailSend":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.itemLists":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"jason","username":"tephlon","bio":null,"verified":true,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/ee7788870e9ab8d34c979c940727f579ecc3c3e8f60069d1297d51eb30af831e?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1500,"template_name":"User Enablement Demo","unique_visitors":1394,"unique_weekly_visitors":13,"unique_monthly_visitors":23,"unique_inserters":79,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":1},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1507","wf_detais":{"id":1507,"name":"Send Telegram messages on RSS feed read","createdAt":"2022-03-07T01:36:39.492Z","description":"2 telegram Description Description Description","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.cron":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.function":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.rssFeedRead":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"teaker","username":"teaker","bio":null,"verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/9c1026291e7967f649ba43c01292f4ea8f7782df82018636836f446ae276b287?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1507,"template_name":"Send Telegram messages on RSS feed read","unique_visitors":618,"unique_weekly_visitors":8,"unique_monthly_visitors":15,"unique_inserters":424,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":3},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1511","wf_detais":{"id":1511,"name":"Send Typeforms leads via Whatsapp (Twilio)","createdAt":"2022-03-10T13:55:53.654Z","description":"Send Typeforms leads via Whatsapp (Twilio)","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":4,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.twilio":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.typeformTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Jean-Elie Lecuy","username":"jean-elie","bio":null,"verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/3986f35ed0565b086cc495c99c10bca55cdef5bf781bec4e0a68977eb258cd1d?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1511,"template_name":"Send Typeforms leads via Whatsapp (Twilio)","unique_visitors":406,"unique_weekly_visitors":7,"unique_monthly_visitors":12,"unique_inserters":76,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":1},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1514","wf_detais":{"id":1514,"name":"Bulk Emails with personalized attachment","createdAt":"2022-03-12T18:44:28.818Z","description":"A workflow to send personalized emails with respective attachment.\n\n\nThe workflow needs a pre-formatted CSV with file names and email IDs.

Not a Sendgrid user? Simply remove the Sendgrid node and add a Gmail node instead. The stock exchange has a REST API? Just throw away the HTML Extract node.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n# Data Source\n\nIn this scenario, our data source is Baserow. In our table, we’ll track all information needed to identify each investment product:\n\n![image.png](fileId:660)\n\nWe have two text type columns (**Name** and **ISIN**) as well as two number type columns (**Count** and **Purchase Price**).\n\n# Workflow\n\n![image.png](fileId:661)\n\n## Nodes\n\n### 1. Cron\n\nThe Cron node will trigger our workflow to run each work day in the morning hours.\n\n### 2. Baserow\n\nThe Baserow node will fetch our investments from the database table shown above.\n\n### 3. HTTP Request\n\nUsing the HTTP Request node we can fetch live data from the stock exchange of our choice based on the ISIN. This example uses Tradegate, which is used by many German fintechs. The basic approach should also work for other exchanges, as long as they provide the required data to the public.\n\n### 4. HTML Extract\n\nSince our HTTP Request node fetches full websites, we’re using the HTML Extract node to extract the information we’re looking for from each website. If an exchange other than Tradegate is used, the selectors used in this node will most likely need to be updated.\n\n### 5. + 6. Set\n\nThe Set nodes helps with setting the exact columns we’ll use in our table. In this case we’re first formatting the results from our exchange, then calculate the changes based on the purchase price.\n\n### 7. Function\n\nHere were using a bit of Javascript magic to build an HTML email. This is where any changes to the email content would have to be made.\n\n### 8. Sendgrid\n\nFinally we send out the email built in the previous step. This is where you can configure sender and recipients.\n\n# Result\n\nThe basic email generated by this workflow will look like so:\n\n![image.png](fileId:659)","categories":[{"id":8,"name":"Finance"},{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":9,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.cron":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.baserow":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.function":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.sendGrid":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.htmlExtract":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Tom","username":"mutedjam","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["https://github.com/that-one-tom/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/7a3710173e907baffaf7ed7ebffc37955c9cdeadb8612200225a34a2e056aa17?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1785,"template_name":"Track investments using Baserow and n8n","unique_visitors":1096,"unique_weekly_visitors":30,"unique_monthly_visitors":40,"unique_inserters":148,"unique_weekly_inserters":3,"unique_monthly_inserters":3},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1787","wf_detais":{"id":1787,"name":"Upload leads from a CSV file to Pipedrive CRM","createdAt":"2022-09-09T11:43:13.319Z","description":"This workflow gets leads' contacts from a CSV file and adds it to the Pipedrive CRM by creating an organization and a person.

Don't worry, no coding is needed, it's just a simple JSON! You can even use the \"Ask AI\" in the cloud version of n8n to generate mock values for you. These values are permanently stored in the workflow ensuring swift and reliable execution.\n\n2. 🔀 The \"Firstname,\" \"Lastname,\" and \"Occupation\" nodes extract invividual variables. Two Merge nodes create a combination of all possible values. Adapt this section based on your needs.\n\n3. 🎲 The \"Random\" node shuffles the generated data.\n\n4. 🔢 Use the \"Limit\" node to control the number of output items.\n\n5. ✨ Perform additional post-processing, such as deriving email addresses based on the user's name and surname.\n\nAnd there you have it!

It starts with either a form submission or a webhook trigger, allowing users to input data, URLs or IPs that require analysis. The workflow then splits into two paths depending on whether the input data is an IP or URL. If an IP was given, it sets the ip variable to the IP; however if a URL was given the workflow will perform a DNS lookup using Google Public DNS and sets the ip variable based on the results from Google.\n\nThe workflow then checks the obtained IP addresses against GreyNoise services, with one branch utilizing GreyNoise RIOT IP Lookup to assess IP reputation and association with known benign services, and the other using GreyNoise IP Context to evaluate potential threats. The results from both GreyNoise services are merged to create a comprehensive analysis which includes the IP, classification (benign, malicious, or unknown), IP location, tags to identify activity or malware, category, and trust level. \n\nIn parallel, a VirusTotal scan is initiated for the URL/IP to identify if it is malicious. A 5-second wait ensures proper processing, and the workflow subsequently polls the scan result to determine when the analysis is complete. The workflow then summarizes the analysis including the overall security vendor analysis results, blockList analysis, OpenPhish analysis, the URL, and the IP.\n\nFinally, the workflow combines the summarized intelligence from both GreyNoise and VirusTotal to provide a thorough analysis of the URL/IP. This summarized intelligence can then be emailed to the user that filled out the form via Gmail or it can be sent to the user via a Slack message.\n\nSetting up this workflow may require proper configuration of the form submission or webhook trigger, and ensuring that the GreyNoise and VirusTotal API credentials are correctly integrated.

The response is then split into individual detections for further processing. Each detection is enriched by querying the CrowdStrike API for detailed information using another HTTP Request node. The workflow then processes these detections sequentially using the Split In Batches node.\n\nNext, it looks up behavioral information associated with each detection in VirusTotal using two HTTP Request nodes. One node queries VirusTotal based on SHA256 values, and the other based on IOC (Indicator of Compromise) values. The workflow includes a 1-second pause using the Wait node to prevent rate limiting when making requests to the VirusTotal API.\n\nSubsequently, the workflow sets fields with relevant details from both CrowdStrike and VirusTotal, including detection links, confidence scores, filenames, usernames, and more. These details are concatenated using an Item Lists node for each detection. The final step involves creating Jira issues for each detection, including summaries with CrowdStrike alert severity and hostnames, as well as descriptions that incorporate information from CrowdStrike and VirusTotal. Information about this issue is then sent via a Slack message to a Slack user.\n\nPotential issues during setup might include configuring the Schedule Trigger node to trigger at the correct time zone and handling potential rate limiting from the VirusTotal API, which could lead to throttled requests.

It starts with the IMAP node, which is set to ingest emails and identify those with .eml attachments.\n\nOnce an email with an attachment is ingested, the workflow progresses to a conditional operation where it checks for the presence of attachments. If an attachment is found, the binary data is moved and converted to JSON format, preparing it for further analysis. This meticulous approach to detecting attachments is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture, allowing for the proactive identification and handling of potentially malicious content.\n\nIn the subsequent stage, the workflow leverages the capabilities of Sublime Security by analyzing the email attachment. The binary file is scrutinized for threats, and upon detection, the information is split to matched and unmatched data. This process not only speeds up the threat detection mechanism but also ensures compatibility with other systems, such as Slack, resulting in a smooth and efficient workflow. This automation emphasizes operational efficiency with minimal user involvement, enhancing the organization's defense against cyber threats.\n\nThe final phase of the workflow involves preparing the output for a Slack report. Whether a threat is detected or not, n8n ensures that stakeholders are immediately informed by dispatching comprehensive reports or notifications to Slack channels.

It begins by fetching a list of watched IP addresses and expected ports through an HTTP request. Each IP address is then processed in a sequential loop.\n\nFor every IP, the workflow sends a GET request to Shodan, a renowned search engine for internet-connected devices, to gather detailed information about the IP. It then extracts the data field from Shodan's response, converting it into an array. This array contains information on all ports Shodan has data for regarding the IP.\n\nA filter node compares the ports returned from Shodan with the expected list obtained initially. If a port doesn't match the expected list, it is retained for further processing; otherwise, it's filtered out. For each such unexpected port, the workflow assembles data including the IP, hostnames from Shodan, the unexpected port number, service description, and detailed data from Shodan like HTTP status code, date, time, and headers.\n\nThis collected data is then formatted into an HTML table, which is subsequently converted into Markdown format. Finally, the workflow generates an alert in TheHive, a popular security incident response platform. This alert contains details like the title indicating unexpected ports for the specific IP, a description comprising the Markdown table with Shodan data, medium severity, current date and time, tags, Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) set to Amber, a new status, type as 'Unexpected open port', the source as n8n, a unique source reference combining the IP with the current Unix time, and enabling follow and JSON parameters options.

This access_token can be used to call APIs connected to this identity provider (for example, we call userinfo API with this token).\n\nExample : asks a user to log in with his Google account then call an API (Gmail, drive...) with his own token.\n\n# How it works\n\nWe published a blog post about this flow, how it works and how you can use it : \n[https://blog.please-open.it/n8n-openid-client/](https://blog.please-open.it/n8n-openid-client/)","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"},{"id":29,"name":"SecOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":15,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.html":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"please-open.it","username":"please-open-it","bio":"Authentication consultant with over 6 years experience, we can help companies with their SSO, especially with Keycloak","verified":false,"links":["https://blog.please-open.it"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/07abf2c86f638d25ac295d52c898529e41369832bfc7c7b81253142fc190c48d?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1997,"template_name":"Authenticate a user in a workflow with openid connect","unique_visitors":1302,"unique_weekly_visitors":23,"unique_monthly_visitors":29,"unique_inserters":233,"unique_weekly_inserters":3,"unique_monthly_inserters":4},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/1998","wf_detais":{"id":1998,"name":"WordPress-to-Pipedrive Integration: Automating Contact & Lead Management","createdAt":"2023-11-29T14:33:07.637Z","description":"## How it Works:\n\n- **Capture Contact Requests:** This template efficiently handles contact requests coming through a WordPress website using the Contact Form 7 (CF7) plugin with a webhook extension.\n- **Contact Management:** It automatically creates or updates contacts in Pipedrive upon receiving a new request.\n- **Lead Management:** Each contact request is securely stored in the lead inbox of Pipedrive, ensuring no opportunity is missed.\n- **Task Creation:** For each new contact or update, the workflow triggers the creation of a related task, streamlining follow-up actions.\n- **Note Attachment:** A comprehensive note containing all details from the contact request is attached to the corresponding lead, ensuring that all information is readily accessible.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide:\n**Estimated Setup Time:** The setup process is straightforward and can be completed quickly.

Sometimes we are not able to access a PC to resolve an issue if something goes wrong with a workflow. If you, like me, use Telegram to send yourself error reports, you can quickly react in case of urgency. Just by sending '/stop' combined with the name you use for a workflow, you can deactivate a workflow, or reactivate it with '/start'. For example '/stop marketing'.\n\nWalkthrough: [https://watch.screencastify.com/v/uWQ88gZKj57WTGOOqSW2](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/uWQ88gZKj57WTGOOqSW2) (6min)\n\n## Instructions\n1. Create a Telegram API key through botfather ([https://t.me/botfather](https://t.me/botfather)). Add it to the telegram credentials.\n2. For the N8N nodes, go to settings in your n8n instance. Then 'n8n API' and 'create an API key'. \n3. To ensure that only we can send commands to the bot, we need the chat ID of our DM with our newly created bot. Open the the Telegram trigger and click on 'listen to events'.\n4. Go to Telegram and send a direct message to the bot, this will trigger the Telegram node.\n5. Go to the filter node and fill in the chat id you want to filter for with the data you got from the test event in the Telegram node.\n6. In the first Switch node you can find the commands, in this case it is '/start' and '/stop'. When you send a message to your bot starting with either of those, it will go to the next switch nodes.\n7. Next it will check what other word it contains. As an example I have used the words 'marketing' and 'sales', both corresponding to a marketing and sales workflow. \n8. The last nodes will either activate or deactivate a workflow.","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":12,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.n8n":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.telegramTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"MilanWR","username":"milanwr","bio":null,"verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/250cc11c9a8bb778dcc43c7b21112f5ffbb438820be9c4ceb57a188bcd44dc69?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":1999,"template_name":"(De)activate n8n workflows using Telegram commands","unique_visitors":388,"unique_weekly_visitors":3,"unique_monthly_visitors":6,"unique_inserters":129,"unique_weekly_inserters":2,"unique_monthly_inserters":4},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2006","wf_detais":{"id":2006,"name":"AI agent that can scrape webpages","createdAt":"2023-12-06T14:45:11.358Z","description":"![n8nReAct.webp](fileId:720)\n\n⚙️🛠️🚀🤖🦾\n\nThis template is a PoC of a ReAct AI Agent capable of fetching random pages (not only Wikipedia or Google search results).\n\nOn the top part there's a manual chat node connected to a LangChain ReAct Agent. The agent has access to a workflow tool for getting page content.\n\nThe page content extraction starts with converting query parameters into a JSON object.

For longer pages an error message is returned back to the agent\n\nPage content fetching is a multistep process:\n1. An HTTP Request mode tries to get the page content.\n\nIf the page content was successfuly retrieved, a series of post-processing begin:\n\n2. Extract HTML BODY; content\n3. Remove all unnecessary tags to recude the page size\n4. Further eliminate external URLs and IMG scr values (based on the method query parameter)\n5. Remaining HTML is converted to Markdown, thus recuding the page lengh even more while preserving the basic page structure\n6.

It should be located under the following URL:\n\n**https://api.slack.com/apps/[SLACK_APP_ID]/general**\n\n### Input\nThe input should be the received Slack request. This workflow should then be placed directly after the Slack Webhook.\n\n### Outputs\n#### Success Output\nIf the signature was verified successfully, we return a key `verified_signature` set to `true` along with data from the Slack request itself.\n\n#### Error Output\nWhen the signature could not be verified, we raise an error. You can handle this case in your main workflow by using an Error Workflow or by changing your node settings and choosing some actions in case of an error.\n\n## Changelog\n### Version 1.0.1 (2023-12-11)\n- Changed `replace` by `replaceAll` in JS code in case of several arguments.\n- Added some custom replacements that `encodeURIComponent` does not take into account\n","categories":[{"id":29,"name":"SecOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":12,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.crypto":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.stopAndError":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Henri","username":"chabs","bio":null,"verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/80223d9d7e7ef01eea33348e0255636fbb80d3fe42139dbf7f1ac24d6dbe17c8?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2009,"template_name":"Slack Webhook - Verify Signature","unique_visitors":414,"unique_weekly_visitors":6,"unique_monthly_visitors":6,"unique_inserters":59,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":1},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2012","wf_detais":{"id":2012,"name":"Perform a domain search  with Icypeas (single)","createdAt":"2023-12-11T15:55:30.622Z","description":"This template can be used to scan a domain/company with [Icypeas](https://www.icypeas.com/).

It is designed to alert users when inventory levels are low or out of stock, integrating with Shopify's webhook system and providing notifications through Discord (can be changed to any messaging platform) with product images and details.\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\nWebhook Node (Shopify Listener): This node is set up to listen for Shopify's inventory level webhook. It triggers the workflow whenever there is an update in the inventory levels. The webhook is configured in Shopify settings, where the n8n URL is specified to receive inventory level updates.\n\nFunction Node (Inventory Check): This node processes the data received from the Shopify webhook. It extracts the available inventory and the inventory item ID, and determines whether the inventory is low (less than 4 items) or out of stock.\n\nCondition Nodes (Inventory Level Check): Two condition nodes follow the function node. One checks if the inventory is low (low_inventory equals true), and the other checks if the inventory is out of stock (out_of_stock equals true).\n\nGraphQL Node (Product Details Retrieval): Connected to the condition nodes, this node fetches detailed information about the product using Shopify's GraphQL API. It retrieves the product variant, title, current inventory quantity, and the first product image.\n\nHTTP Node (Discord Notification): The final node in the workflow sends a notification to Discord. It includes an embed with the product title, a warning message (\"This product is running out of stock!\"), the remaining inventory quantity, product variant details, and the product image. The notification ensures that relevant stakeholders are immediately informed about critical inventory levels.","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":15,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.graphql":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"siyad","username":"salsiy","bio":"","verified":false,"links":["https://www.spiritofdevops.com"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/0ea4a894fb1911782b1ed4cafb5f51dcd297452b71e077a91929b41e4461c244?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2027,"template_name":"Low Stock & Sold Out Watcher for Shopify","unique_visitors":443,"unique_weekly_visitors":7,"unique_monthly_visitors":11,"unique_inserters":34,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":1},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2032","wf_detais":{"id":2032,"name":"Poll emails using JMAP ","createdAt":"2023-12-25T11:22:32.536Z","description":"n8n does not currently offer a way to retrieve emails from arbritrary providers via a regular node. Unless you're using Gmail or Outlook, you can only use the email trigger to start a workflow when a new email arrives.\n\nThis currently limits the possible use cases you can cover in your n8n workflows, as you cannot (for example) get an idea of how many unread messages there are in an inbox, or search for specific messages when an event occurs.\n\nBut fear not, there's a new sheriff in town! The [JMAP standard](https://jmap.io/index.html) allows you to interact with your mailboxes, calendars and contacts through single HTTP requests whenever needed.\n\nThis n8n workflow demonstrates how to retrieve the total number of unread messages from a JMAP server and also retrieve details for the first 3 messages. It can easily be adapted to search for messages other than unread, or to return details for more than the first 3 messages.\n\n# Screenshots\n\n![image.png](fileId:722)\n\n![image.png](fileId:721)\n\n# FAQ\n\n## Which n8n version do I need?\n\nThe workflow was built using n8n 1.20 and should work here out of the box. HTTP requests are also supported on older n8n versions, so the workflow can be backported as an alternative.\n\n## Which credentials do I need?\n\nThe JMAP standard does not limit the available authentication options. Fastmail (the sponsor of the standard) supports Bearer authentication as well as OAuth2.\n\nIn n8n you can implement the Fastmail Bearer authentication by creating Header Auth credentials with a name of `Authorization` and a value of `Bearer $apiToken` (replacing `$apiToken` with your actual API token from Fastmail).\n\nFor other services you'd need to check the respective API documentation for more details on the support authentication methods. \n\n## What even is JMAP?\n\nIt's an official Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard, sponsored by Fastmail, that will hopefully replace the legacy standards CalDAV, CardDAV, and IMAP soon. The full specs are [available here](https://jmap.io/spec.html).\n\n## How can I use JMAP?\n\nIf you're a [Fastmail](https://ref.fm/u30544864) customer or if you're hosting your own [Stalwart mail server](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-server) you can use JMAP today.\n\nIf your email provider doesn't yet support JMAP, you might want to contact them and let them know you're interested in this functionality.","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Tom","username":"mutedjam","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["https://github.com/that-one-tom/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/7a3710173e907baffaf7ed7ebffc37955c9cdeadb8612200225a34a2e056aa17?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2032,"template_name":"Poll emails using JMAP ","unique_visitors":58,"unique_weekly_visitors":1,"unique_monthly_visitors":1,"unique_inserters":28,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":0},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2033","wf_detais":{"id":2033,"name":"Real-time lead routing in Webflow","createdAt":"2023-12-28T22:10:10.596Z","description":"This workflow will allow you to enrich in real-time a form submission from Webflow using Datagma. \n\nBased on the result of this workflow, a specific Calendly link will be shown on the website.\n\n- If the process outcome is '1', a link for a one-on-one demo will be provided.\n- If the process outcome is '2', a link for a group demo will be shown.\n\nFull guide here: [Real-time Lead Routing](https://lempire.notion.site/Real-time-lead-routing-9fc55c9a5a17415ba736cbdbf5d43a30?pvs=4)\n","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":10,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Lucas Perret","username":"lucasperret","bio":"","verified":true,"links":[""],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/0b3273e259147247b9921e13c536e06521ebd68ba5198aaff9b141db51eb3d94?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2033,"template_name":"Real-time lead routing in Webflow","unique_visitors":330,"unique_weekly_visitors":9,"unique_monthly_visitors":14,"unique_inserters":42,"unique_weekly_inserters":2,"unique_monthly_inserters":2},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2034","wf_detais":{"id":2034,"name":"Send DingTalk message on new Azure DevOps Pull Request","createdAt":"2023-12-29T02:20:48.068Z","description":"This template automates sending a DingTalk message on new Azure Dev Ops Pull Request Created Events.

Ideal for traders and enthusiasts seeking real-time market insights.\n\n[![659d07c153303c6de24e6442.jpg](fileId:730)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/slG_q_sT_E8)\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Trigger Options**: Choose between a manual trigger or a scheduled trigger to start the workflow.\n2. **Fetch Market Data**: The 'Binance 24h Price Change' node retrieves the latest 24-hour price changes for cryptocurrencies from Binance.\n3. **Identify Significant Changes**: The 'Filter by 10% Change rate' node filters out cryptocurrencies with price changes of 10% or more.\n4. **Aggregate Data**: The 'Aggregate' node combines all significant changes into a single dataset.\n5. **Format Data for Telegram**: The 'Split By 1K chars' node formats this data into chunks suitable for Telegram's message size limit.\n6. **Send Telegram Message**: The 'Send Telegram Message' node broadcasts the formatted message to a specified Telegram chat.\n\n### Set Up Steps\n* **Estimated Time**: About 1-5 minutes for setup.\n* **Initial Configuration**: Set up a Binance API connection (Optional) and your Telegram bot credentials.\n* **Customization**: Adjust the trigger according to your preference (manual or scheduled) and update the Telegram chat ID.\n\n* **Create Telegram bot steps**:-\nSetting up a Telegram bot and obtaining its token involves several steps. Here's a detailed guide:\n\n1. **Start a Chat with BotFather:**\n   - Open Telegram and search for \"BotFather\". This is the official bot that allows you to create new bots.\n   - Start a chat with BotFather by clicking on the \"Start\" button at the bottom of the screen.\n\n2. **Create a New Bot:**\n   - In the chat with BotFather, type `/newbot` and send the message.\n   - BotFather will ask you to choose a name for your bot. This is a display name and can be anything you like.\n   - Next, you'll need to choose a username for your bot. This must be unique and end in `bot`. For example, `my_crypto_alert_bot`.\n\n3. **Receive Your Token:**\n   - After you've set the name and username, BotFather will provide you with a token. This token is like a password for your bot, so keep it secure.\n   - The message will look something like this: \n     ```\n     Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/my_crypto_alert_bot. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands. Use this token to access the HTTP API: 123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11\n     ```\n   - The token in this case is `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`.\n\n4. **Test Your Bot:**\n   - You can find your bot by searching for its username in Telegram.\n   - Start a chat with your bot and try sending it a message. Although it won't respond yet, this step is essential to ensure it's set up correctly.\n\n5. **Use the Token in n8n:**\n   - In your n8n workflow, when setting up the Telegram node, you'll be prompted to enter credentials.\n   - Choose to add new credentials and paste the token you received from BotFather.\n\n6. **Get Your Chat ID:**\n   - To send messages to a specific chat, you need to know the chat ID.\n   - The easiest way to find this is to first message your bot, then use a bot like `@userinfobot` to get your chat ID.\n   - Once you have the chat ID, you can configure it in the Telegram node in your n8n workflow.\n\n7. **Finalize Your Workflow:**\n   - With the bot token and chat ID set up in n8n, your Telegram notifications should work as intended in your workflow.\n\nRemember, keep your bot token secure and never share it publicly. If your token is compromised, you can always generate a new one by chatting with BotFather and selecting `/token`.\n\n### Example result\n\n![siDCAAKSc3.png](fileId:727)\n\n```\nKeywords: n8n workflow, cryptocurrency market, Binance API, Telegram bot, price alert system, automated trading signals, market analysis\n```","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.function":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Nskha","username":"nskha","bio":"Welcome to Nskha!

It utilizes the public blockchain database of TronScan, requiring no API authentication, to periodically check and process transaction data. This workflow is ideal for users who need an automated solution to track their TRC20 wallet transactions.\n\n## Features\n\n* **Automated Tracking**: Executes every 15 minutes to capture new transactions.\n* **Customizable Filters**: Tailors the tracking based on specific parameters like transaction time and wallet addresses.\n* **Data Aggregation**: Compiles transaction data into a single, structured list.\n* **Formatted Outputs**: Presents transaction data in an organized and comprehensible format.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* N8N (self-hosted or cloud version) setup and operational.\n* Basic understanding of N8N workflows and nodes.\n\n## Setup and Configuration\n\n1. **Import Workflow**: Load the provided JSON workflow into your N8N instance.\n2. **Configure Edit Fields Node**:\n  * Enter your TRC20 wallet address in the 'Your Wallet Address' field.\n  * Adjust 'Number of transactions to retrieve per request' if necessary. (Default one set to 20 which is recommanded)\n3. **TronScan Data Access**: The workflow accesses TronScan's public blockchain data, so no additional configuration is required for API access.\n4. **Schedule Trigger Node**: Defaulted to trigger every 15 minutes. Modify as per your requirements.\n5. **Test the Workflow**: Execute the workflow manually to ensure everything is operating correctly.\n\n## How it Works\n\n1. **Schedule Trigger**: Initiates the workflow at predetermined intervals.\n2. **Edit Fields**: Sets up the wallet address and transaction retrieval count.\n3. **TronScan Data Retrieval**: Gathers transaction data from the TRC20 wallet using TronScan's public database.\n4. **Split Out & Filter**: Processes and filters the transaction data.\n5. **Final Results**: Organizes and formats the required transaction data for review.\n6. **Aggregate**: Consolidates all records (items) into a one comprehensive list (item).\n\n![firefox_7ETdE2k8nJ.png](fileId:734)\n\n## Customization\n\n* Modify the filter conditions and fields to suit your tracking needs. (for example you can higher or lower the number of time to filter or IN / OUT transactions - Default is 15m/IN)\n* Adjust the schedule trigger frequency according to your preference (default is 15m).\n\n## Best Practices\n\n* Regularly test the workflow to ensure consistent performance.\n* Stay updated with any changes to the structure of TronScan's public data that might affect the workflow.\n\n## Contributing\n\nYour feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated. Feel free to adapt, modify, and share enhancements with the n8n community.","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Nskha","username":"nskha","bio":"Welcome to Nskha!

It is ideal for users who need immediate notifications and a secure, temporary web view of their email content.\n\n## Use Cases\n- Immediate notification of new emails in Telegram with the ability to preview the email content in a secure, temporary HTML format.\n- Automation for users who need to keep track of their emails without constantly checking their email client.\n- Useful for teams or individuals who require instant updates on critical emails and prefer a quick preview through a web interface.\n\n## My Personal Use Case: Secure Subscription Sharing\nFrom time to time, I find myself wanting to share my paid subscriptions with friends, but giving out OTP codes manually or sharing my email isn't a good idea due to security concerns. I attempted to use the IMAP node to integrate with Telegram secret channel for this purpose but encountered numerous problems, such as difficulties in scraping content from emails. Additionally, the Telegram API sometimes rejects certain special characters found within email contents. After facing these challenges, I discovered that rendering emails as HTML pages and sharing them directly is the most effective solution. This approach bypasses the issues with character limitations and content scraping, providing a seamless way to share subscription benefits securely.\n\n## Services/APIs Used\n\n| Service/API          | Node Type               | Description                                          |\n|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| IMAP Email Server    | Email Trigger (IMAP)    | Triggers the workflow on receiving a new email.      |\n| Telegram API         | Telegram                | Sends notifications and manages messages in Telegram.|\n| GitHub Gist API      | HTTP Request (Github Gist) | Temporarily hosts email content on GitHub Gist. |\n| GitHub Gist API (Deletion) | HTTP Request (Github Gist ‌) | Deletes the temporary GitHub Gist after a specified time. |\n| Wait                 | Wait                    | Delays the workflow for a specified period.          |\n\n## Configuration Steps\n1. **Email Trigger (IMAP):** Configure your IMAP email credentials to enable the workflow to check for new emails.\n2. **Telegram Nodes:** Insert your Telegram bot's API credentials and your chat ID in both Telegram nodes to send and delete messages.\n3. **Github Gist Nodes:** Provide your GitHub API credentials to create and delete Gists. Ensure the GitHub token has the necessary permissions to create and delete Gists.\n4. **Wait Node:** Adjust the wait time according to your preference for how long the email content should be accessible via the HTML page.\n\n## Screenshot\n![Workflow Screenshot](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/Automations-Project/n8n-templates/main/Email%20Notifications%20to%20Telegram%20using%20Temporary%20HTML%20Hosting%20via%20GitHub%20Gist/preview.png)\n\n## Additional Notes\n- Ensure all credentials are securely stored and have the minimum necessary permissions for the workflow to function.\n- Test the workflow with non-sensitive emails to ensure it operates as expected before using it with critical email accounts.\n- Consider the privacy and security implications of temporarily hosting email content on GitHub Gist.\n\nFor any questions or issues, refer to the respective API documentation for each service used or consult the n8n community for support.","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.emailReadImap":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Nskha","username":"nskha","bio":"Welcome to Nskha!

It starts with a Schedule Trigger node that sets the interval for the workflow. The Conditional Check node verifies if certain fields like Name, Gender, Job Title, Summary, and LinkedIn URL are not empty. The HTTP Request node sends a POST request to the specified URL with API key and profile information. The Data Merge node merges the data collected. The Field Editing node modifies the fields as needed. Finally, the Google Sheets Update node updates the Google Sheets with the gathered information.\n\n### Set Up Instructions\n\n1. Make sure to have the necessary credentials and permissions for accessing LinkedIn and Google Sheets.\n2. Set up the API key required for the HTTP Request node.\n3. Configure the Google Sheets Update node with the appropriate document ID and sheet name.\n4. Check and adjust field mappings in the Field Editing node according to your needs.\n5. Run the workflow and monitor the updates in your Google Sheets document.\n\n## Overview:\n\n\nThe workflow is designed to find contact information for LinkedIn profile URLs stored in a Google Sheet. It involves various nodes for different operations such as making HTTP requests, scheduling triggers, reading from and updating Google Sheets, field editing, data merging, and conditional checks. A video demonstrating the workflow process can be accessed [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF9a_UBxWY/xSSlSUzRdxCPtfgx9RzGSg/watch?success=true&continue_in_browser=true).\n\n## Copy this template to get started :\n- [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ochnGSCy8V5Mz-nr51dBmugqR50m62K7d6pvbwOHewo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n## Using Prospeo.io LinkedIn Email Finder API with cURL\n\nTo use the API endpoint \"https://api.prospeo.io/linkedin-email-finder\" with cURL, follow these steps:\n\n1. Use the cURL command with the following parameters:\n   \n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-KEY: your_api_key\" \\\n-d '{\n  \"url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-doe/\"\n}' \\\n\"https://api.prospeo.io/linkedin-email-finder\"\n```\n\n2. Replace \"your_api_key\" with your actual API key.\n3. Update the \"url\" field in the JSON data with the LinkedIn profile URL for which you want to find the email address.\n\nTo get access to this API and obtain your API key, you need to sign up on the Prospeo platform and subscribe to their LinkedIn email finder service. Once you have subscribed, you will receive an API key that you can use to authenticate your requests to the API endpoint.\n## Description:\n\n- **Schedule Trigger:**\n  - Triggers the workflow based on a defined schedule interval, in this case, based on minutes.\n  - [Schedule Trigger Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger)\n\n- **Google Sheets Read:**\n  - Reads data from a Google Sheets document and sheet based on the provided document ID and sheet name.\n  - [Google Sheets Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets) \n  \n- **Conditional Check:**\n  - Checks multiple conditions based on the input data and performs actions accordingly.\n  - [Conditional Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if)\n\n- **HTTP Request:**\n  - Sends an HTTP POST request to a specified URL with headers and body parameters.\n  - [HTTP Request Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest)\n\n\n- **No Operation, do nothing:**\n  - Placeholder node that does not perform any operation.\n\n- **Data Merge:**\n  - Merges data based on specified mode and combination settings.\n  - [Merge Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge)\n\n- **Field Editing:**\n  - Edits fields by setting specific values for each field based on input data.\n  - [Set Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set)\n\n- **Google Sheets Update:**\n  - Updates data in a Google Sheets document and sheet based on specified columns and values.\n  - [Google Sheets Node Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets)\n","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":11,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"AlQaisi","username":"omar","bio":"I'm specialize in automation and AI, developing innovative solutions to enhance efficiency and drive innovation.

Based on this, it assigns the deal to the right sales rep within your company.\n# Requirements\n- New deals in Hubspot need to be unassigned in the beginning\n- New deals have to have an attached contact that has an attached company in Hubspot\n- The company needs to have values for region and employee count in Hubspot\n# Setup\nThe setup is quite straight forward and will probably take a few minutes only.\n1. Add your **Hubspot** credentials\n2. Customize your criterias for assigning deals in the `Assign by Region` and the following `Assign` nodes\n3. Make sure deals are assigned to the right salesrep in the Hubspot nodes at the end\n4. Activate the workflow\n# Customizing this to your needs\n- Adjust the trigger interval to your needs. Currently, it defaults to once a day\n- Adjust your region settings by adding/updating/removing options in the respective node\n- Adjust your employee size settings by adding/updating/removing options in the respective node\n# Ideas to enhance this flow\n- Wrap each region's assigned criteria into different sub-workflows for easier maintainability. This will not consume additional execution counts.\n- Add more logic on what happens once a deal does not match any criteria you've set","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":22,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.hubspot":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Niklas Hatje","username":"nik8n","bio":"Product Manager at n8n - Responsible for the creator program","verified":true,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklashatje/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e16a4426e166713c34626bdde856b1cd15bb6787481a7ead9b74318f19e6259d?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2117,"template_name":"Auto-assign deals in Hubspot to fitting sales reps based on geo and company size","unique_visitors":148,"unique_weekly_visitors":7,"unique_monthly_visitors":8,"unique_inserters":22,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":1},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2118","wf_detais":{"id":2118,"name":"Send follow-ups using Gmail to Hubspot contacts","createdAt":"2024-02-22T12:29:34.962Z","description":"## Use Case\nFollowing up at the right time is one of the most important parts of sales.

The workflow can be triggered manually via the \"Execute Workflow\" button or scheduled to run at a specific time using the \"Schedule Trigger\" node.\n\n2. The sitemap of your website is fetched using the \"sitemap_set\" node with a HTTP Request to the sitemap URL. \n\n3. This XML sitemap is then converted into a JSON file using the \"sitemap_convert\" node.\n\n4. The \"sitemap_parse\" node splits the JSON file into individual URLs.\n\n5. The \"url_set\" node then prepares each URL to be sent to the Google Indexing API.\n\n6. A loop is created using the \"loop\" node to process each URL individually and make a POST request to Google Indexing API indicating that the URL has been updated.\n\n7. If the POST request is successful and the URL has been updated, the workflow waits for 2 seconds before moving to the next URL.\n\n8. In case the daily limit for the Google Indexing API is reached (200/day by default), an error message is triggered using the \"Stop and Error\" node.\n# Before you use the workflow\n## Activate the indexing API\n* Create an account with Google Cloud Platform &gt; Console and then create a new project\n* Search for the Indexing API in the Library\n* Activate the API\n\n## Create a Service Account and get credentials\n* Open the Service accounts page. If prompted, select a project.\n* Click add Create Service Account, enter a name and description for the service account. You can use the default service account ID, or choose a different, unique one. \n* When done click Create.\n* On the Grant users access to this service account screen, scroll down to the Create key section. Click add Create key.\n* In the side panel that appears, select the JSON format\n* Click Create. Your new public/private key pair is generated and downloaded to your machine.\n* Open the file and copy the private key.\n* Add the credentials in the url_index node\n\n![image.png](fileId:743)\n\n\n## Add the user as owner of the site\nBeware, for each site you need to add the user as a owner like this:\n\n![image.png](fileId:742)\n\n## Set your sitemap\n\n* Open the sitemap_set node and add the url to your sitemap.\n\n-------\n*Now you should be able to ensure that Google is always up-to-date with the latest content on your website, improving your website's visibility and SEO rankings, have fun!*","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":12,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.xml":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stopAndError":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Joachim Brindeau","username":"joachimbrindeau","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/174b62612bac1c4785b1fae6e60956cdd087547f050c6fdd183b9a14c39e31a2?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2123,"template_name":"Simple Google indexing Workflow in N8N","unique_visitors":1410,"unique_weekly_visitors":16,"unique_monthly_visitors":23,"unique_inserters":169,"unique_weekly_inserters":2,"unique_monthly_inserters":4},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2124","wf_detais":{"id":2124,"name":"List social media activity of a company before a call","createdAt":"2024-02-23T08:13:28.377Z","description":"# How it works\nIt’s very important to come prepared to Sales calls.

Usually, you'd have to manually review each lead to determine if they're a good fit. This process is time-consuming and increases the chances of missing important leads. This workflow ensures every new lead is promptly evaluated upon addition.\n## What this workflow does\nThe workflow runs every 5 minutes. On every run, it checks your new Pipedrive leads and enriches them with Clearbit. It then marks items as enriched and checks if the company of the new lead matches certain criteria (in this case if they are B2B and have more than 100 employees) and sends a Slack alert to a channel for every match.\n## Pre Conditions\nYou must have Pipedrive, Clearbit, and Slack accounts. You also need to set up the custom fields `Domain` and `Enriched at` in Pipedrive.\n## Setup\n1. Go to Company Settings -&gt; Data fields -&gt; Organization and add `Domain` as a custom field\n2. Go to Company Settings -&gt; Data fields -&gt; Leads and add `Enriched at` as a custom date field\n2. Add your `Pipedrive`, `Clearbit` and `Slack` credentials.\n3. Fill the `setup` node below. To get the ID of your custom domain fields, simply run the `Show only custom organization fields` and `Show only custom lead fields` nodes below and copy the keys of your `domain`, and `enriched at` fields.\n## How to adjust this workflow to your needs\n- Modify the criteria to suit your definition of an interesting lead.\n- If you only want to focus on interesting leads in Pipedrive, add a node that archives all others.\n\nThis workflow was built using n8n version 1.29.1\n","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":20,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.clearbit":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.pipedrive":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Niklas Hatje","username":"nik8n","bio":"Product Manager at n8n - Responsible for the creator program","verified":true,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklashatje/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e16a4426e166713c34626bdde856b1cd15bb6787481a7ead9b74318f19e6259d?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2135,"template_name":"Enrich new leads in Pipedrive and send an alert to Slack for high-quality ones","unique_visitors":337,"unique_weekly_visitors":7,"unique_monthly_visitors":11,"unique_inserters":28,"unique_weekly_inserters":2,"unique_monthly_inserters":3},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2136","wf_detais":{"id":2136,"name":"Verify & enrich form leads with Hunter and Clearbit then add them to Pipedrive","createdAt":"2024-02-28T11:11:05.616Z","description":"## Use case\nWhen collecting leads via an online form, you often need to manually add those new leads into your Pipedrive CRM.

Since we're using Slack, this seemed to be the perfect place to easily add ideas and collect them in Notion.\n## What this workflow does\nThis workflow waits for a webhook call within Slack, that gets fired when users use the `/idea` command on a bot that you will create as part of this template. It then checks the command, adds the idea to Notion, and notifies the user about the newly added idea as you can see below:\n\n![image 16.png](fileId:751)\n## Creating your Slack bot\n1.

Since we're using our product at n8n a lot, we wanted to make it as easy as possible for everyone to add bugs with the needed level of detail. That's why we built this workflow that allows everyone to add bugs to our Linear account easily directly from Slack\n## What this workflow does\nThis workflow waits for a webhook call within Slack, that gets fired when users use the `/bug` command on a bot that you will create as part of this template. It then adds the bug to Linear using a pre-defined description and a defined label. It then notifies the user about the newly added bug as you can see below:\n\n![image 17.png](fileId:762)\n\n## How to create your Slack bot\n1. Visit https://api.slack.com/apps, click on New App and choose a name and workspace.\n2. Click on OAuth & Permissions and scroll down to Scopes -&gt; Bot token Scopes\n3. Add the `chat:write` scope\n4. Head over to `Slash Commands` and click on `Create New Command`\n5. Use `/bug` as the command\n6. Copy the test URL from the **Webhook** node into `Request URL`\n7. Add whatever feels best to the description and usage hint\n8. Go to `Install app` and click install\n\n## Setup\n1. Configure your Slack bot using the sticky to the left\n2. Fill the `Set me up` node. You can find the IDs easily using the Helper nodes section\n3. Make sure to exchange the `Request URL` in your Slack with the Prod URL of the Webhook node before activating this workflow  \n\n## How to adjust it to your needs\n- Add zero, one, two or many labels when creating the new ticket\n- Change the Slack message according to your needs\n- Change the default description for a new bug ticket\n- Rename the Slack command as it works best for you\n\n## How to enhance this workflow\nAt n8n we use this workflow in combination with some others. E.g. we have the following things on top:\n- We're using AI to classify the bugs and move them to the right team as soon as they get added to Linear (see [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2154-classify-new-bugs-in-linear-with-openais-gpt-4-and-move-them-to-the-right-team))\n- We also added other commands like `/pain` and `/idea` that allow us to submit other things to Notion.

Normally this includes a manual grooming of new bugs that have arrived in your ticketing system (in our case Linear). We found this way too time-consuming. That's why we built this workflow.\n\n## What this workflow does\nThis workflow triggers every time a Linear issue is created or updated within a certain team. For us at n8n, we created one general team called Engineering where all bugs get added in the beginning. The workflow then checks if the issue meets the criteria to be auto-moved to a certain team. In our case, that means that the description is filled, that it has the bug label, and that it's in the `Triage` state. The workflow then classifies the bug using OpenAI's GPT-4 model before updating the team property of the Linear issue. If the AI fails to classify a team, the workflow sends an alert to Slack.\n\n## Setup\n1. Add your Linear and OpenAi credentials\n2. Change the team in the `Linear Trigger` to match your needs\n3. Customize your teams and their areas of responsibility in the `Set me up` node. Please use the format `[Teamname][Description/Areas of responsibility]`. Also, make sure that the team names match the names in Linear exactly.\n4. Change the Slack channel in the `Set me up` node to your Slack channel of choice.\n\n## How to adjust it to your needs\n- Play around with the context that you're giving to OpenAI, to make sure the model has enough knowledge about your teams and their areas of responsibility\n- Adjust the handling of AI failures to your needs\n\n## How to enhance this workflow\nAt n8n we use this workflow in combination with some others. E.g. we have the following things on top:\n- We're using an automation that enables everyone to add new bugs easily with the right data via a `/bug` command in Slack (check out [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2153-add-a-bug-to-linear-via-slack-command) if that's interesting to you)\n\nThis workflow was built using n8n version 1.30.0\n","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":12,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.linear":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.linearTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Niklas Hatje","username":"nik8n","bio":"Product Manager at n8n - Responsible for the creator program","verified":true,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklashatje/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e16a4426e166713c34626bdde856b1cd15bb6787481a7ead9b74318f19e6259d?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2154,"template_name":"Classify new bugs in Linear with OpenAI's GPT-4 and move them to the right team","unique_visitors":450,"unique_weekly_visitors":10,"unique_monthly_visitors":13,"unique_inserters":42,"unique_weekly_inserters":3,"unique_monthly_inserters":5},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2155","wf_detais":{"id":2155,"name":"Generating Keywords using Google Autosuggest","createdAt":"2024-02-29T21:16:39.285Z","description":"This workflow is aimed at generating keywords for SEO and articles\nTo get started, you need to use the workflow as it is.

At n8n, we have been using them to get a lot done.. But it can become hard to manage and maintain many different operations that a workflow can do.\n\nThis is the base workflow we use for our most powerful internal Slackbots. They handle a lot from running e2e tests for Github branch to deleting a user. By splitting the workflow into many subworkflows, we are able to handle each command seperately, making it easier to debug as well as support new usecases.\n\nIn this template, you can find eveything to setup your own Slackbot (and I made it simple, there's only one node to configure 😉). After that, you need to build your commands directly. \n\nThis bot can create a new thread on an alerts channel and respond there.\n![Screenshot 20240301 at 07.54.07.png](fileId:769)\n![Screenshot 20240301 at 08.03.33.png](fileId:767)\n\nOr reply directly to the user.\n![Screenshot 20240301 at 07.53.41.png](fileId:766)\n\nIt responds for help request to return a help page.\n![Screenshot 20240301 at 08.16.40.png](fileId:764)\n\nIt automatically handles unknown commands.\n![Screenshot 20240301 at 08.16.54.png](fileId:765)\n\nIt also supports flags and environment variables.

Import the workflow into your n8n workspace\n2. Set your WordPress URL in the `wordpress_url` field in the \"Settings\" node. Include the slash (`/`) at the end of the URL\n3. Set up your Open AI n8n credentials by following [this guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/). The Open AI credentials are used by the Open AI nodes (\"Create post title and structure\", \"Create chapters text\", and \"Generate featured image\")\n4. Set up your WordPress n8n credentials by following [this guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/wordpress/).

Tired of manually clicking through each page in the Google Search Console? 😴 Say goodbye to that tedious process and hello to automation with this n8n workflow! 🎉\n\n**NB: this workflow was tested with sitemap.xml generated by Ghost CMS and WordPress.\nReach out to [Eduard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parsadanyan/) if you need help adapting this workflow to your specific use-case!**\n\n## ⚙️ How this automation works\n\n1. 📅 The workflow runs on a schedule or when you click \"Test workflow\".\n2. 🌐 It fetches the website's primary sitemap.xml and extracts all the content-specific sitemaps (this is a typical structure of the sitemap).\n3. 📑 Each content-specific sitemap is then parsed to retrieve the individual page data.\n4. 🔄 The extracted page data is converted to JSON format for easy manipulation.\n5. 🗃️ The `lastmod` (last modified date) and `loc` (page URL) fields are assigned to each page entry to ensure compliance with the [Sitemap protocol](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html).\n6. 🔀 The page entries are sorted by the `lastmod` field in descending order (newest to oldest).\n7. 🔁 The workflow then loops over each page entry and performs the following steps:\n   - 🔍 Checks the URL metadata in the Google Indexing API.\n   - ✅ If the page is new or has been updated since the last indexing request, it sends a request to the Google Indexing API to update the URL.\n   - ⏳ Wait a sec and move on with the next page.\n\n## 🌟 Benefits\n\n- ⏰ Save time by automating the indexing process.\n- 🎯 Ensure all your website pages are consistently indexed by Google.\n- 🚀 Improve your website's visibility and search engine rankings.\n- 🛠️ Customize the workflow to fit your specific CMS and requirements.\n\n## 🔧 Getting started\n\nTo start using this powerful n8n workflow, follow these steps:\n\n1. ☑️ Make sure to verify the website ownership in the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).\n2. 👨‍💻 Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance.\n3. **Edit the `Get sitemap.xml` node and update the URL with your website's valid sitemap.xml**\n4. 🔑 Set up the necessary credentials for the Google Indexing API.\n5. 🎚️ Adjust the schedule trigger to run the workflow at your desired frequency.\n7. 🎉 Sit back and let the workflow handle the indexing process for you!\n\nReady to take your website indexing to the next level? 🚀 Try this workflow now and see the difference it makes! 😊\n\n### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE 1\nNeed help with connecting Google Cloud Platform to n8n? Check out our [article on connecting Google Sheets to n8n](https://blog.n8n.io/google-sheets-as-database/#step-1-obtain-google-service-account-credentials). The process is mainly the same. When activating Google APIs, make sure to add `Web Search Indexing API`. Also, in the credential page of n8n, add the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/indexing` scope:\n\n![image.png](fileId:781)\n\nCheck out [Yulia's page](https://n8n.io/creators/yulia/) for more n8n workflows!\n\n### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE 2\nFree Google Cloud Platform account allows (re)indexing only 200 pages per day. If your website has more, then the workflow will automatically fail on quota limit ⛔. Next day it will skip the previously added items and continue with remaining pages. \n\n***Example:*** Assuming you have a free Google account, 500 pages on your website and they don't change for 3 days:\n* On the first day 200 pages will be added for indexing and the workflow will fail due to quota limits.\n* On the second day, the workflow will check 200 pages again and skip them (because the date of re-indexing is later then the page last modified date). The next 200 pages will be added to indexing. Workflow will fail again due to quota limits.\n* On the third day 400 pages will be checked and skipped, the last 100 pages will be added for indexing and the workflow finishes successfully.","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":21,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.xml":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.sort":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Eduard","username":"eduard","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/parsadanyan/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a551e67c6fe7affd5f882a527dee154bb6c3ac90cf878326accb3fb3ec77c8a6?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2210,"template_name":"Get your website indexed by Google automatically","unique_visitors":1918,"unique_weekly_visitors":30,"unique_monthly_visitors":44,"unique_inserters":500,"unique_weekly_inserters":3,"unique_monthly_inserters":7},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2211","wf_detais":{"id":2211,"name":"Batch update all your Youtube video descriptions in one click","createdAt":"2024-04-01T17:00:13.935Z","description":"Keeping your YouTube video descriptions updated and consistent across your channel can be a daunting task.

By converting text into speech, users can enjoy promotional material hands-free, making it easier to consume information while on the go or relaxing. The workflow consists of several key steps orchestrated seamlessly to deliver a delightful experience to users.\n\n### How to Use the Workflow:\n\n1. **Gmail trigger Node**: Initiates the workflow by fetching \"CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS\" emails at regular intervals.\n\n     The Gmail Trigger node in your N8N workflow is set to poll for new emails every minute and is configured to filter emails with the label \"CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS\" before triggering the workflow.\n\n   #### Steps to Use Filters Inside the Gmail Trigger Node:\n\n\n\n   Configure Gmail Trigger Node:\n\n   Set \"Poll Times\" to \"Every Minute\" to check for new emails at regular intervals.\nEnable the \"Simple\" toggle if you want to simplify the node interface.\nUnder \"Filters\", specify the label IDs you want to filter by. In this case, it's set to \"CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS\".\nAdjust any additional options as needed.\n\n\n    // Configure Gmail Trigger node pollTimes: { item: [ { mode: \"everyMinute\" } ] }, simple: false, filters: { labelIds: [ \"CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS\" ] }, options: {}\n\n\n\n      **Save and Execute**:\n   - Save your workflow and execute it to start monitoring your Gmail account for new emails with the specified label filter.\n\n     By following these steps, your workflow will effectively trigger based on new emails that match the \"CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS\" label in your Gmail account.\n\n2. **Get message content Node**: Extracts the email content for processing.\n      \n3. **Summarization Chain Node**: Generates concise summaries using advanced methods for better readability.\n   \n4. **Delete the unnecessary items Node**: Removes irrelevant details from the email content.\n   \n5. **Text to Free TTS Node**: Converts the summary text into speech using Free TTS technology.\n   \n6. **Convert from base64 to File Node**: Transforms the audio data into a compatible file format.\n   \n7. **Merge Text with Audio Node**: Combines the text and audio components seamlessly.\n   \n8. **Aggregate in same cell Node**: Gathers all processed data for finalization.\n   \n9. **Send Message to Telegram Node**: Dispatches the audio message along with a caption to a designated Telegram chat ID.\n\nBy automating these tasks, the workflow ensures efficient communication and delivers content in a more engaging format, fostering a positive user experience.\n\n### Configuration Instructions:\n\nThe configuration of this workflow involves setting up the necessary nodes and establishing connections between them. Each node performs a specific function crucial to the overall operation of the workflow. Additionally, credentials need to be provided for accessing Gmail and OpenAI services to enable seamless data processing and summarization.\n\n## Utilizing Text-to-Speech API 🎧\n\nIn addition to n8n automation, an external Text-to-Speech API plays a pivotal role in generating audio content from text data. By sending a POST request with JSON data containing the text and voice preferences, users can quickly receive audio files of the converted content. The API offers a straightforward interface for text-to-speech conversion, making it ideal for creating audio clips efficiently.\n\nTo access this API, simply submit the desired text and voice selection to receive the generated speech audio file. The API endpoint can be accessed at [https://tiktok-tts.weilnet.workers.dev/api/generation](https://tiktok-tts.weilnet.workers.dev/api/generation) or through [https://tiktokvoicegenerator.com/](https://tiktokvoicegenerator.com/).\n\nIn conclusion, this n8n workflow coupled with a Text-to-Speech API presents a powerful solution for transforming emails into captivating podcasts, enhancing user engagement and communication effectiveness. By embracing automation and innovative technologies, this project aims to improve user experience and streamline content delivery processes. 🌈✨🚀","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":14,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmailTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.convertToFile":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainSummarization":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"AlQaisi","username":"omar","bio":"I'm specialize in automation and AI, developing innovative solutions to enhance efficiency and drive innovation.

Unfortunately, not every software still supports XML, as many switched to more modern storing languages such as JSON. This workflow is designed to handle the conversion of XML data to JSON format via a webhook call, with error handling and Slack notifications integrated into the process. \n\n## How this workflow works\n1. **Triggering the workflow:**\n    - This workflow initiates upon receiving an HTTP POST request at the webhook endpoint specified in the \"POST\" node. The endpoint, designated as <WEBHOOK_URL>, can be accessed externally by sending a POST request to that URL.\n2. **Data routing and processing:**\n    - Upon receiving the POST request, the Switch node routes the workflow's path based on conditions determined by the content type of the incoming data or any encountered errors.\n    - The Extract From File and Edit Fields (Set) nodes manage XML input processing, adapting their actions according to the data's content type.\n3. **XML to JSON conversion**:\n    - The XML data extracted from the input is passed through the \"XML\" node, which performs the conversion process, transforming it into JSON format.\n4. **Response handling:**\n- If the XML-to-JSON conversion is successful, a success response is sent back with a status of \"OK\" and the converted JSON data.\n- If there are any errors during the XML-to-JSON conversion process, an error response is sent back with a status of \"error\" and an error message.\n- Error handling: in case of an error during processing, the workflow sends a notification to a Slack channel designated for error reporting.\n\n## **Set up steps**\n1. Set up your own <WEBHOOK_URL> in the Webhook node. While building or testing a workflow, use a test webhook URL. When your workflow is ready, switch to using the production webhook URL. \n2. Set credentials for Slack.","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":null},"user":{"name":"n8n Team","username":"n8n-team","bio":"Meet the official n8n team.

It can be particularly useful for:\n\n- The accounting department: for generating invoices in PDF format, thus streamlining the invoicing process and payment tracking.\n- The human resources department: for creating employment contracts in PDF, simplifying the administrative management of employees.\n- IT project management teams: for producing Word documents, such as project specifications, to clearly define project requirements and objectives.\n\n#### Example result in mail\n\n![invoice.png](fileId:794)\n\nThis PDF and Word document generation workflow offers a practical and efficient solution for automating administrative and document-related tasks, allowing teams to focus on higher-value activities.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow currently operates with an n8n form, but you can easily replace this form with a webhook triggered by an external application such as AirTable, SharePoint, DocuWare, etc.\n\nOnce the configuration information is retrieved, we fill the API request body of JSReport. The body is defined at the time of template creation in JSReport ([Example of JSReport usage](https://youtu.be/nz1SKdOKAhM?si=aMWGMgMuYCnky28z)).\n\nThen, in a straightforward manner, we fetch the PDF and send it via email.\n\nHere's a brief overview of this n8n workflow template: [Link to n8n workflow template presentation](https://youtu.be/jjjXCj3flPI?si=C73gd51ZeQ_l-1Bh)\n\n\n## To summarize\n\n1. This workflow integrates with an n8n form, but it's flexible to work with various triggering methods like webhooks from other applications such as AirTable, SharePoint, or DocuWare.\n2. After configuring the necessary information, it populates the API request body of JSReport, which defines the template in JSReport.\n3. Once the template is populated, it retrieves the PDF and sends it via email.\n4. In essence, it streamlines the process of generating PDF documents based on user input and distributing them via email.\n\n## Instructions:\n\n1. Create a JSReport Account: Sign up for a JSReport account to create your PDF template model.\n2.

Thank you for the groundwork, Matheus.\n\n## How it works:\n1. Store your snippets of text in a Notion table.  Each snippet should have an image associated with it (copy + pasted into the text)\n2. Connect to your table via a Notion _\"integration\"_, from which N8N can then query your pre-meditated posts\n3. The text is fed through an OpenAI assistant to boost engagement via formatting\n4. The re-formatted text along with the image pulled from the Notion snippet are combined into a post for your LinkedIn\n5. The row in the original Notion table from step 1 containing this post is set to a status of _\"Done\"_\n\n## Set up steps:\n- You will need to create a Notion _\"integration\"_, which will yield a _\"secret key\"_ which you enter into your N8N as a _\"Credential\"_. \n- You will need to create a LinkedIn _\"app\"_ in order to post on your behalf.  When creating your LinkedIn _\"app\"_, you will be required to link this _\"app\"_ to a company page on LinkedIn.  If you are doing this for yourself, seach for the _\"Default Company Payge (for API testing)\"_, and select this page as it is provided by LinkedIn for individuals.  You can find your LinkedIn apps here, and if you get stuck, further instructions on setting up this workflow (including this LinkedIn OAuth piece) can be found in this [YouTube Video Aide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOgmv6E9PAM) to these instructions.\n- Lastly, you will need to create an OpenAI API key, found on your [OpenAI Playground Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat).  Once you created an API key, make sure you have an assistant created from the _\"Assistants\"_ tab on the OpenAI dashboard.  This assistant and its instructions will be needed for carrying out the re-formatting of your post.  \n\n\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":11,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.notion":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.linkedIn":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Paul Mikulskis","username":"mikulskisp","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/978a9c81151d490ba1e67c51987fa2fe27df5856c9b7dfb2645d33a794f0c6c6?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2288,"template_name":"Automate LinkedIn Outreach with Notion and OpenAI","unique_visitors":3385,"unique_weekly_visitors":73,"unique_monthly_visitors":122,"unique_inserters":420,"unique_weekly_inserters":11,"unique_monthly_inserters":13},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2289","wf_detais":{"id":2289,"name":"Restore backed up workflows from GitHub to n8n","createdAt":"2024-06-11T09:05:22.408Z","description":"Restore backed up workflows from GitHub to your n8n workspace.\nThis workflow was inspired by [this one](https://n8n.io/workflows/1534-back-up-your-n8n-workflows-to-github/) that lets you back up your n8n workflows to GitHub.\nIt will let you restore your backed up workflows in your workspace, without creating duplicates.\nIn case of issue with your instance, it will save you a lot of time to restore them.\n\n\n## How it works\n- It retrieves the workflows saved in a GitHub repository.\n- Then compares these saved workflows with the ones in your n8n workspace based on the name.\n- It will only create them if they don't already exist.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n1.

It assumes there is a custom \"website\" field in your Pipedrive setup, as data will be scraped from this website to generate a note using OpenAI. Then, a notification is sent in Slack.\n\n## ⚠️ Disclaimer\n**This workflow uses a scraping API. Before using it, ensure you comply with the regulations regarding web scraping in your country or state**.\n\n## Important Notes\n- The **OpenAI model used is GPT-4o**, chosen for its large input token capacity. However, it is not the cheapest model if cost is very important to you.\n\n- The system prompt in the OpenAI Node generates output with relevant information, but feel free to improve or **modify it according to your needs**.\n\n## **How It Works**\n\n### Node 1: `Pipedrive Trigger - An Organization is Created`\nThis is the trigger of the workflow. When **an organization object is created in Pipedrive**, this node is triggered and retrieves the data. **Make sure you have a \"website\" custom field in Pipedrive** (the name of the field in the n8n node will appear as a random ID and not with the Pipedrive custom field name).\n\n### Node 2: `ScrapingBee - Get Organization's Website's Homepage Content`\nThis node **scrapes the content** from the URL of the website associated with the **Pipedrive Organization** created in Node 1. The workflow uses the [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/) API, but **you can use any preferred API or simply the HTTP request node in n8n**.\n\n### Node 3: `OpenAI - Message GPT-4o with Scraped Data`\nThis node sends HTML-scraped data from the previous node to the **OpenAI GPT-4o model**. The system prompt instructs the model to **extract company data**, such as products or services offered and competitors (if known by the model), and format it as HTML for optimal use in a Pipedrive Note.\n\n### Node 4: `Pipedrive - Create a Note with OpenAI Output`\nThis node **adds a Note to the Organization created in Pipedrive** using the OpenAI node output. The Note will include the company description, target market, selling products, and competitors (if GPT-4o was able to determine them).\n\n### Node 5 & 6: `HTML To Markdown` & `Code - Markdown to Slack Markdown`\nThese two nodes **format the HTML output to Slack Markdown**.\n\nThe Note created in Pipedrive is in HTML format, **as specified by the System Prompt of the OpenAI Node**. To send it to Slack, it needs to be converted to Markdown and then to Slack Markdown.\n\n### Node 7: `Slack - Notify`\nThis node **sends a message in Slack containing the Pipedrive Organization Note** created with this workflow.\n","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.markdown":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.pipedrive":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.pipedriveTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Dataki","username":"dataki","bio":"I am passionate about transforming complex processes into seamless automations with n8n.

Developers can utilize it as an alternative to n8n's built-in OAuth flow to achieve improved control and visibility. In this template, I've used [Pipedrive API](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/Oauth#get-tokens), but users can apply it with any app that requires the authorization_code for token access.\n\nThis resolves the issue of manually refreshing the OAuth 2.0 token when it expires, or when n8n's native OAuth stops working.\n\n## What you need to replicate this\n\n1. Your database with a pre-existing table for storing authentication tokens and associated information. I'm using Supabase in this example, but you can also employ a self-hosted MySQL.\n\nHere's a [quick video](https://go.screenpal.com/watch/cZiXhEV8N0y) on setting up the Supabase table.\n\n\n2. Create a client app for your chosen application that you want to access via the API.\n\n3. After duplicating the template:\n\na. Add credentials to your database and connect the DB nodes in all 3 workflows.\n\n4. Enable/Publish the first workflow, \"1. Generate and Save Pipedrive tokens to Database.\"\n\n5. Open your client app and follow the Pipedrive instructions to authenticate.\n\nClick on [Install and test](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/image/49321214?key=886672146f2ba1b1482d43a625b72f10).\n\n\nThis will save your initial refresh token and access token to the database.\n\n6. Please watch the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/6nXi_yverss) for a detailed demonstration of the workflow:\n\n\n## How it operates\n\n**Workflow 1**. Create a workflow to capture the authorization_code, generate the access_token, and refresh the token, and then save the token to the database.\n\n**Workflow 2**. Develop your primary workflow to fetch or post data to/from your application. Observe the logic to include an if condition when an error occurs with an invalid token. This triggers the third workflow to refresh the token.\n\n**Workflow 3**. This workflow will handle the token refresh.

After submitting a Google Form, the user receives a notification via WhatsApp. These notifications are sent via a template message.\n2. In case user sends a message to the bot, the text and user data is stored in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-B0yepcrCHxQpn7Sj6QjTa0VqwwVBQhO5ZcIUSxWJE/edit?resourcekey=&gid=1621824221#gid=1621824221).\n3. To reply back to the user, fill in the `ReplyText` column and change the Status to 'Ready'. In a few seconds n8n will fetch the unsent replies and deliver them one by one via WhatsApp Business node.\n\nCustomize this workflow to fit your specific needs, connect different online services and enhance your customer communication! 🎉\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\nTo get this workflow up and running, you'll need to:\n\n1. 👇 Create a WhatsApp template message on the Meta Business portal. <details>![messagetemplate.png](fileId:817)</details>\n\n2. Obtain an Access Token and WhatsApp Business Account ID from the Meta Developers Portal. This is needed for the **WhatsApp Business Node** to send messages.\n![credentialssetup.png](fileId:815)\n\n3. Set up a **WhatsApp Trigger** node with App ID and App Secret from the Meta Developers Portal.\n![credentialswebhook.png](fileId:814)\n\n4. Right after that copy the **WhatsApp Trigger** URL and add it as a Callback URL in the Meta Developers Portal. This trigger is needed to receive incoming messages and their status updates.\n![credentialstrigger.png](fileId:816)\n\n5. Connect your Google Sheets account for data storage and management. Check out the [documentation page](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).\n\n## ⚠️ Important Notes\n\n- WhatsApp allows automatic *custom text* messages only within 24 hours of the last user message. Outside with time frame only *approved template messages* can be sent.\n- The workflow uses a Google Sheet to manage form submissions, incoming messages and prepare responses. You can replace these nodes and connect the WhatsApp bot with other systems.","categories":[{"id":13,"name":"Support"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":15,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.whatsApp":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.whatsAppTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheetsTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Eduard","username":"eduard","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/parsadanyan/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a551e67c6fe7affd5f882a527dee154bb6c3ac90cf878326accb3fb3ec77c8a6?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2340,"template_name":"🚀 Boost your customer service with this WhatsApp Business bot!","unique_visitors":7468,"unique_weekly_visitors":225,"unique_monthly_visitors":377,"unique_inserters":881,"unique_weekly_inserters":25,"unique_monthly_inserters":46},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2341","wf_detais":{"id":2341,"name":"Build a Tax Code Assistant with Qdrant, Mistral.ai and OpenAI","createdAt":"2024-07-11T10:41:27.677Z","description":"This n8n workflows builds another example of creating a knowledgebase assistant but demonstrates how a more deliberate and targeted approach to ingesting the data can produce much better results for your chatbot.\n\nIn this example, a government tax code policy document is used. Whilst we could split the document into chunks by content length, we often lose the context of chapters and sections which may be required by the user.\n\nOur approach then is to first split the document into chapters and sections before importing into our vector store. Additionally, using metadata correctly is key to allow filtering and scoped queries.\n\n## Example\n\n**Human**: \"Tell me about what the tax code says about cargo for intentional commerce?\"\n\n**AI**: \"Section 11.25 of the Texas Property Tax Code pertains to \"MARINE CARGO CONTAINERS USED EXCLUSIVELY IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE.\" In this section, a person who is a citizen of a foreign country or an en...\"\n\n## How it works\n\n* The tax code policy document is downloaded as a zip file from the government website and its pages are extracted as separate chapters.\n* Each chapter is then parsed and split into its sections using data manipulation expressions.\n* Each section is then inserted into our Qdrant vector store tagged with its source, chapter and section numbers as metadata.\n* When our AI Agent needs to retrieve data from our vector store, we use a custom workflow tool to perform the query to Qdrant.\n* Because we're relying on Qdrant's advanced filtering capabilities, we perform the search using the Qdrant API rather than the Qdrant node.\n* When the AI Agent, needs to pull full wording or extracts, we can use Qdrant's scroll API and metadata filtering to do so. This makes Qdrant behave like a key-value store for our document.\n\n## Requirements\n* A Qdrant instance is required for the vector store and specifically for it's filtering functionality.\n* Mistral.ai account for Embeddings and AI models.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n\nDepending on your use-case, consider returning actual PDF pages (or links) to the user for the extra confirmation and to build trust.\n\nNot using Mistral? You are able to replace but note to match the distance and dimension size of Qdrant collection to your chosen embedding model.","categories":[{"id":8,"name":"Finance"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":38,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.compression":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolWorkflow":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStoreQdrant":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsMistralCloud":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Jimleuk","username":"jimleuk","bio":"Freelance consultant based in the UK specialising in AI-powered automations.

And it works both ways.\n\n### What events are supported?\n\nEverything except recurring events.\n\nAll day events, multiple day events, start and end date… these are all supported.\n\nYou set them in Notion and they stay in sync with Google. And vice versa.\n### Why doesn’t it support recurring events?\n\nNotion doesn’t support recurring events yet.\n\nSo when you create a recurring event in Google, it will only consider the first date, ignoring future occurrences of the event.\n\n### Can I connect more than one Notion database?\n\nYes. You can have many Notion databases synced to one Google Calendar account.\n\nYou can see how to do it in the workflow instructions.\n\nIt is recommended that you create more calendars in your account, so that you can link each calendar to a different database in Notion. But that’s a choice.\n![image 1.png](fileId:823)\n\n### What happens if I delete an event or page?\n\n- Notion page deleted → Deletes event in Google\n- Notion date property cleared → Deletes event in Google\n- Google event deleted → Clears the date property in Notion, but keeps the page, so you don’t lose your work.\n\n### Does it update the events?\n\nYes. When you update the event in Google or in Notion it syncs both ways.\n\n### How can I know what Notion item was linked to an event?\n\nEither by the name or by clicking the hyperlink in the event description that says: **👉 View in Notion**.\n\n\n### When I create a new event in Google, does it add an item to Notion?\n\nYes. When you create an event inside one of your calendars, the item is synced to the corresponding Notion database.\n\n### Does it sync event descriptions?\n\nNo. The event description will always be “View in Notion”. Even if you change it in Google Calendar it will be overwritten when you make a change to the Notion page.\n\n🎉 When you buy this template you receive step-by-step instructions on how to set it up.\n\n### Check out my other templates\n👉 [**https://n8n.io/creators/solomon/**](https://n8n.io/creators/solomon/)","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":127,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":16},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.notion":{"count":16},"n8n-nodes-base.dateTime":{"count":10},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":29},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":15},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.notionTrigger":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.googleCalendar":{"count":9},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleCalendarTrigger":{"count":6}}}},"user":{"name":"Solomon","username":"solomon","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["https://t.me/salomaoguilherme"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/79aa147f090807fe0f618fb47a1de932669e385bb0c84bf3a7f891ae7d174256?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2351,"template_name":"2-way sync Notion and Google Calendar","unique_visitors":808,"unique_weekly_visitors":18,"unique_monthly_visitors":29,"unique_inserters":10,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":1},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2352","wf_detais":{"id":2352,"name":"Create Teams Notifications for new Tickets in ConnectWise with Redis","createdAt":"2024-07-22T10:13:42.326Z","description":"This Workflow does a HTTPs request to ConnectWise Manage through their REST API. \n\nIt will pull all tickets in the \"New\" status or whichever status you like, and notify your dispatch team/personnel whenever a new ticket comes in using Microsoft Teams. \n\nVideo Explanation https://youtu.be/yaSVCybSWbM","categories":[{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.redis":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.microsoftTeams":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Gavin","username":"sniped-you-fool","bio":null,"verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/c9bf5420133c3612bddb5a889d41f5868bb101104e18bb879589c541216010af?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2352,"template_name":"Create Teams Notifications for new Tickets in ConnectWise with Redis","unique_visitors":658,"unique_weekly_visitors":25,"unique_monthly_visitors":35,"unique_inserters":73,"unique_weekly_inserters":2,"unique_monthly_inserters":2},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2353","wf_detais":{"id":2353,"name":"Send Slack notifications when a new release is published for public Github repos","createdAt":"2024-07-24T09:20:39.536Z","description":"This workflow checks a configured list of Github repositories daily to see if a new release has been published.\n\n### How it works:\n- Workflow has a daily trigger\n- `RepoConfig` node is a JSON array that defines a list of repositories to check releases for\n- For each of the configured repos it fetches the latest release\n- If the release was published within the last 24 hours it is output\n- The release is sent as a Slack message showing the repo name, release name and link\n\n\n### Setup\n- Update the JSON in the RepoConfig node to the Github repos you wish to get notifications for\n- Setup your Slack connection (or replace with your choice of notification)\n","categories":[{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Damian Karzon","username":"dkarzon","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[""],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a5e1a9790861eaa4f54b083abc142c94da0010ca05a167b0e307a3d2d5bbb594?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2353,"template_name":"Send Slack notifications when a new release is published for public Github repos","unique_visitors":209,"unique_weekly_visitors":8,"unique_monthly_visitors":10,"unique_inserters":47,"unique_weekly_inserters":2,"unique_monthly_inserters":2},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2354","wf_detais":{"id":2354,"name":"Automate Competitor Research with Exa.ai, Notion and AI Agents","createdAt":"2024-07-24T11:35:16.291Z","description":"This n8n workflow demonstrates a simple multi-agent setup to perform the task of competitor research.

Those reports contain data if email they received passed DKIM and SPF verifications. \n\nSince DMARC email is public, you will receive a lot of emails from email providers, not only if DKIM/SPF fail.

Emails are processed by AI and converted to rather actionable task.\n\nIn addition this workflow is build in a way, that multiple users can share this single process by setting up their individual configuration through a user friendly portal (internal tool) instead of the need to manage their own workflows.\n\n## Demo\n\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7cIvSqJAY0E/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7cIvSqJAY0E)\n\n## How it works\n\n- One Gmail account is used to process inbound mails from different users.\n- A custom web portal enables users to define “routes”. Thats where the mapping between an automatically generated Gmail Alias and a Notion Database URL, including the personal API Token, happens.\n- Using a Gmail Trigger, new entries are split by the Email Alias, so the corresponding route can be retrieved from the Database connected to the portal.\n- Every Email then gets processed by AI to get generate an actionable task and get a short summary of the original Email as well as some metadata.\n- Based on a predefined structure a new Page is created in the corresponding Notion Database.\n- Finally the Email is marked as “processed” in Gmail.\n- If an error happens, the route gets paused for a possible overflow and the user gets notified by Email.\n\n## Setup\n\n- Create a new Google account (alternatively you can use an existing one and set up rules to keep your inbox organized)\n- Create two Labels in Gmail: “Processed” and “Error”\n- Clone [this Softr template including the Airtable dataset](https://studio.softr.io/dashboard?template_id=164f2a23-00c8-4e6b-8bb7-b413b8df6f3a) and publish the application\n- Clone this workflow and choose credentials (Gmail, Airtable)\n- Follow the additional instructions provided within the workflow notes\n- Enable the workflow, so it runs automatically in the background\n\n## How to use\n\n- Open published Softr application\n- Register as a new user\n- Create a new route containing the Notion API key and the Notion Database URL\n- Expand the new entry to copy the Email address\n- Save the address as a new contact in your Email provider of choice\n- Forward an Email to it and watch how it gets converted to an actionable task\n\n## Disclamer\n\n- Airtable was chosen, so you can setup this template fairly quickly. It is advised to replace the persistence by something you own, like a self hosted SQL server, since we are dealing with sensitive information of multiple users\n- This solution is only meant for building internal tools, unless you own an embed license for n8n.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":38,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.airtable":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":13},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmailTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolCalculator":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserStructured":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Mario","username":"octionic","bio":"Workflow Optimization Expert | Software Architect.

This isn't likely to work without some tinkering, but should be a good head start on receiving/routing IOT/MQTT messages and hooking up to a Spotify-like API.\n## Requirements\n* An IOT device capable of generating events that can be delivered as MQTT messages through an MQTT Broker\n  * e.g. [Ikea Strybar remote](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/styrbar-remote-control-smart-white-80488370/)\n* An MQTT Broker to which n8n can connect and consume messages\n  * e.g. Zigbee2MQTT in HomeAssistant\n* A Spotify **developer-account** (which provides access to API functions via OAuth2 authorization)\n* A Spotify **user-account** (which provides access to Spotify streamed content, user settings, etc.)\n\n## Setup\n1. Create an MQTT Credential item in n8n and assign it to the MQTT Trigger node\n1. Modify the MQTT trigger node to match the topic for your IOT device messages\n1. Modify the switch/router nodes to map to the message text from your IOT button (e.g. arrow_left_click, brightness_up_click, etc.)\n1. Create a Spotify **developer-account** (or use the login for a **user-account**)\n1. Create an \"App\" in the **developer-account** to represent the n8n workflow\n    * Chicken/Egg ALERT: The n8n Spotify Credentials dialog box will display the \"OAuth Redirect URL\" required to create the App in Spotify, but the n8n Credential item itself cannot be created until AFTER the App has been created.\n1. Create a Spotify Credentials item in n8n\n    * Open the Settings on the Spotify App to find the required Client ID and Client Secret information.\n    * ALERT: Save this before proceeding to the Connect step.\n1. Connect the n8n Spotify Credential item to the Spotify **user-account**\n    * ALERT: Expect n8n to open a separate OAuth2 window on authorization.spotify.com here, which may require a login to the Spotify **user-account**\n1. Open each of the HTTP and Spotify nodes, one by one, and re-assign to **your** Spotify Credential (try not to miss any).\n    * (Then, probably, upvote this feature request: [https://community.n8n.io/t/select-credentials-via-expression/5150](https://community.n8n.io/t/select-credentials-via-expression/5150)\n1. Modify the variable values in the Globals node to match your own environment.\n    * target_spotify_playback_device_name - The name of a playback device available to the Spotify user-account\n    * favorite_playlist_name - The name of a playlist to start when one of the button actions is indicated in the MQTT message.  Used in example \"Custom Function 2\" sequence.\n\n## Notes\n* You're on your own for getting the multi-button remote switch talking to MQTT, figuring out what the exact MQTT topic name is, and mapping the message parts to the workflow (actions, etc.).\n* The next / previous actions are wired up to **not** transfer control to the target device. This alternative routing just illustrates a different behavior than the remaining actions/functions, which include activation of the target device when required.\n* Some of the Spotify API interactions use the Spotify node in n8n, but many of the available Spotify API functions are limited or not implemented at all in the Spotify node.  So, in other cases, a regular HTTP node is used with the Spotify OAuth2 API credential instead.  By modifying one of the examples included in the template, it should be possible to call nearly anything the Spotify API has to offer.\n\n## Spotify+n8n OAuth Mini-Tutorial\n### Definitions\n* The **developer-account** is the Spotify login for creating a **spotify-app** which will be associated with a **client id** and **client secret**.\n* The **user-account** is the Spotify login that has permission to stream songs, set up playback devices, etc.\n* ++A **spotify-login** allows access to a Spotify **user-account**, _or_ a Spotify **developer-account**, **_OR BOTH_**++\n* The **spotify-app**, which has a **client id** and **client secret**, is an object created in the **developer-account**.\n* The **app-implementation** (in this case, an ++n8n workflow++) uses the **spotify-app's** credentials (client id / client secret) to call Spotify API endpoints **on behalf of** a **user-account**.\n\n### Using One Spotify Login as Both User and Developer\nWhen an n8n _Spotify-node_ or _HTTP-node_ (i.e. an **app-implementation**) calls a Spotify API endpoint, the Credentials item **may** be using the **client id and client secret** from a **spotify-app**, which was created in a **developer-account** that is ++**one and the same _spotify-login_** as the **user-account**++.  However, it helps to remind yourself that from the Spotify API server's perspective, the **developer-account + spotify-app**, and the **user-account**, are ++**two independent entities**++.\n\n### n8n Spotify-OAuth2-API Credential Authorization Process\nThe **2** layers/steps, in the process of authorizing an n8n Spotify-OAuth2-API credential to make API calls, are:\n1. n8n must identify itself to Spotify as the **app-implementation** associated with the **developer-account/spotify-app** by sending the app's credentials (client id and client secret) to Spotify.\n    * The Client ID and Client Secret are supplied in the n8n Spotify OAuth2 Credentials UI/dialog-box\n2. Separately, n8n must obtain an authorization token from Spotify to represent the **permissions granted by the user** to execute actions (call API endpoints) **on behalf of** the user (i.e. access things that belong to the **user-account**).\n    * This authorization for the **user-account** access is obtained when the \"Connect\" or \"Reconnect\" button is clicked in the n8n Spotify Credentials UI/dialog-box (which pops up a separate authorization UI/browser-window managed by Spotify).\n    * The Authorization for a given **spotify-app** stays \"registered\" in the **user-account** until revoked.\n      * See: https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-on-other-apps/\n      * Direct Link: https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/\n    * More than one **user-account** _can_ be authorized for a given **spotify-app**. A particular n8n Spotify-OAuth2-API credential item appears to cache an authorization token for the **user-account** that was **_most recently_** authorized.\n      * Up to 25 users can be allowed access to a **spotify-app** in Developer-Mode, but any **user-account** other than the one associated with the **developer-account** must be added by email address at **https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/**_{{app-credential-id}}_**/users**\n    * **ALERT:** IF the browser running the n8n UI is ALSO logged into a Spotify account, and the **spotify-app** is already authorized for that Spotify account, the \"reconnect\" button in the Spotify-OAuth2-API credential dialog may automatically grab a token for that logged in **user-account**, offering no opportunity to select a different **user-account**.\n      * This can be managed somewhat by using \"incognito\" browser windows for n8n, Spotify, or both.\n\n### References\n* [n8n Spotify Credentials Docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/spotify/)\n* [Spotify Authorization Docs](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization)\n\n","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":26,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.spotify":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.mqttTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Hubschrauber","username":"hubschrauber","bio":"Software developer specializing in \"back-end plumbing\" to connect and sync data between large corporate systems, enabling application distribution/migration, scaling, and containerization.

This will be the recipient address for the e-books.\n\n4. **Allow Email Sending to Kindle**:  \n   Ensure your Amazon account is configured to allow emails from your Outlook address to send files to your Kindle.\n\n## Workflow Explanation:\n\n- The workflow begins with a **Telegram bot trigger** node that listens for new chat messages.\n\n- When a new message is received, the workflow checks if the message contains a file attachment.  \n  - If no file is detected, the bot will send a warning reply to the user in the chat.\n\n- If a file is found, it will be renamed to ensure it appears correctly on the Kindle device when sent.\n\n- The workflow then composes an email with the file attached and sends it to the Kindle's receiving address.  \n  - If the email is sent successfully, the bot will notify the user with a success message in the chat.\n\n- Only Amazon-supported file types will be accepted by Kindle.  \n  - If sending fails, you will receive a notification email from Amazon in your Outlook inbox.  \n  - In case of delivery issues, retry sending the file as network issues may occasionally interfere with the process.\n","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.telegramTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.microsoftOutlook":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"CreativeCreature","username":"hulb","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[""],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/f8aff50a90d311778cdd870da15ab45f0e4b3dfa6515083a14e1dad8a4eb4866?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2387,"template_name":"Send file to kindle with Telegram Bot and Outlook","unique_visitors":241,"unique_weekly_visitors":5,"unique_monthly_visitors":8,"unique_inserters":34,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":1},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2388","wf_detais":{"id":2388,"name":"Dynamically generate a webpage from user request using OpenAI Structured Output","createdAt":"2024-08-23T11:00:55.708Z","description":"This workflow is a experiment to build HTML pages from a user input using the new Structured Output from OpenAI.\n\nHow it works:\n- Users add what they want to build as a query parameter\n- The OpenAI node generate an interface following a structured output defined in the body\n- The JSON output is then converted to HTML along with a title\n- The HTML is encapsulated in an HTML node (where the Tailwind css script is added)\n- The HTML is rendered to the user via the Webhook response.\n\nSet up steps\n- Create an [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) \n- Create the OpenAI credentials\n- Use the credentials for both nodes HTTP Request (as Predefined Credential type) and OpenAI\n- Activate your workflow\n- Once active, go to the production URL and add what you'd like to build as the parameter \"query\"\n- Example: https://production_url.com?query=a%20signup%20form\n\nExample of generated page![Screenshot 20240823 at 13.01.56.png](fileId:831)\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.html":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Agent Studio","username":"agentstudio","bio":"We are a product studio that helps organizations leverage no-code and generative AI to automate internal processes and launch new digital products.","verified":true,"links":["https://agentstudio.io/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e9cf0d0fccead46655b11b2ce215cf14d33ecdaa2ce52828f003574c1800e77a?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2388,"template_name":"Dynamically generate a webpage from user request using OpenAI Structured Output","unique_visitors":1894,"unique_weekly_visitors":24,"unique_monthly_visitors":37,"unique_inserters":438,"unique_weekly_inserters":4,"unique_monthly_inserters":9},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2389","wf_detais":{"id":2389,"name":"Recognize invoices / receipts from Google Drive and put them into Google Sheets","createdAt":"2024-08-23T12:25:53.701Z","description":"This workflow allows you to recognize a folder with receipts or invoices (make sure your files are in .pdf, .png, or .jpg format).

When an employee sends a direct message (DM) to the IT department's Slack channel, the workflow is triggered. The initial step involves the \"Receive DMs\" node, which listens for new messages. Upon receiving a message, the workflow verifies the webhook by responding to Slack's challenge request, ensuring that the communication channel is active and secure.\n\nOnce the webhook is verified, the workflow checks if the message sender is a bot using the \"Check if Bot\" node. If the sender is identified as a bot, the workflow terminates the process to avoid unnecessary actions. If the sender is a human, the workflow sends an acknowledgment message back to the user, confirming that their query is being processed. This is achieved through the \"Send Initial Message\" node, which posts a simple message like \"On it!\" to the user's Slack channel.\n\nThe core functionality of the workflow is powered by the \"AI Agent\" node, which utilizes the OpenAI GPT-4 model to interpret and respond to the user's query. This AI-driven node processes the text of the received message, generating an appropriate response based on the context and information available. To maintain conversation context, the \"Window Buffer Memory\" node stores the last five messages from each user, ensuring that the AI agent can provide coherent and contextually relevant answers.\n\nAdditionally, the workflow includes a custom Knowledge Base (KB) tool ([see that tool template here](https://n8n.io/workflows/2398-kb-tool-confluence-knowledge-base/)) that integrates with the AI agent, allowing it to search the company's internal KB for relevant information. After generating the response, the workflow cleans up the initial acknowledgment message using the \"Delete Initial Message\" node to keep the conversation thread clean. Finally, the generated response is sent back to the user via the \"Send Message\" node, providing them with the information or assistance they requested. This workflow effectively automates the IT support process, reducing response times and improving efficiency.\n\nTo quickly deploy the Knowledge Ninja app in Slack, use the app manifest below and don't forget to replace the two sample urls:\n\n```\n{\n    \"display_information\": {\n        \"name\": \"Knowledge Ninja\",\n        \"description\": \"IT Department Q&A Workflow\",\n        \"background_color\": \"#005e5e\"\n    },\n    \"features\": {\n        \"bot_user\": {\n            \"display_name\": \"IT Ops AI SlackBot Workflow\",\n            \"always_online\": true\n        }\n    },\n    \"oauth_config\": {\n        \"redirect_urls\": [\n            \"Replace everything inside the double quotes with your slack redirect oauth url, for example: https://n8n.domain.com/rest/oauth2-credential/callback\"\n        ],\n        \"scopes\": {\n            \"user\": [\n                \"search:read\"\n            ],\n            \"bot\": [\n                \"chat:write\",\n                \"chat:write.customize\",\n                \"groups:history\",\n                \"groups:read\",\n                \"groups:write\",\n                \"groups:write.invites\",\n                \"groups:write.topic\",\n                \"im:history\",\n                \"im:read\",\n                \"im:write\",\n                \"mpim:history\",\n                \"mpim:read\",\n                \"mpim:write\",\n                \"mpim:write.topic\",\n                \"usergroups:read\",\n                \"usergroups:write\",\n                \"users:write\",\n                \"channels:history\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"settings\": {\n        \"event_subscriptions\": {\n            \"request_url\": \"Replace everything inside the double quotes with your workflow webhook url, for example: https://n8n.domain.com/webhook/99db3e73-57d8-4107-ab02-5b7e713894ad\",\n            \"bot_events\": [\n                \"message.im\"\n            ]\n        },\n        \"org_deploy_enabled\": false,\n        \"socket_mode_enabled\": false,\n        \"token_rotation_enabled\": false\n    }\n}\n\n```\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":20,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":9},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolWorkflow":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Angel Menendez","username":"djangelic","bio":"Angel Menendez is a Staff Developer Advocate at n8n.io, specializing in low-code tools for cybersecurity workflows.

Create a new table in Airtable and give it a field *time* with type date, *orderID* with type number, and *orderPrice* also with type number. \n 2. Create a new access token if you haven't already at https://airtable.com/create/tokens/new. Make sure to give the token the scopes *data.records:read*, *data.records:write*, *schema.bases:read* and access to whichever table you choose to store the orders. A pop-up window appears with the token. Use this token to make `Create New Credential` > `Access Token` for Airtable in the `Store Order` and `Airtable Get Today's Orders` nodes.\n 3. Create access credentials for your Gmail as described here: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials. Use the credentials from your *client_secret.json* in the `Send to Gmail` node.\n 4. In the `Store Order` node, change *Base* and *Table* to the database and table in your Airtable account you wish to use to store orders. Make sure to use these same values in the `Airtable Get Today's Orders` node.\n 5. Every time an order is created in your system, send a POST request to Webhook from your order software. Each request must contain a single order containing fields *'orderID'* and *'orderPrice'* (or, edit `Set Order Fields` to select which incoming fields you wish to save)\n 6. Change the schedule time for sending email from `Everyday at 7PM` to whichever time you choose. \n \n\n## Test:\n- Activate the workflow.\n- From the node `Webhook`, copy *Production URL*\n- Send the following CURL request to the URL given to you:\n` curl -X POST   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"   -d '{\"orderID\": 12345, \"orderPrice\": 99.99}' YOUR_URL_HERE`\n- It should say *Node executed successfully*.

Handling multiple binary inputs (ie. images) in an AI request is supported by n8n's basic LLM node.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis template is intended to run as 2 parts: first to generate the base screenshots and next to run the visual regression test which captures fresh screenshots.\n\n* Starting with a list of webpages captured in a Google sheet,  base screenshots are captured for each using a external web scraping service called [Apify.com](https://www.apify.com?fpr=414q6) (I prefer Apify but feel free to use whichever web scraping service available to you)\n* These base screenshots are uploaded to Google Drive and will be referenced later when we run our testing.\n* Phase 2 of the workflow, we'll use a scheduled trigger to fire sometime in the future which will reuse our web scraping service to generate fresh screenshots of our desired webpages.\n* Next, re-download our base screenshots in parallel and with both old and new captures, we'll pass these to our LLM node. In the LLM node's options, we'll define 2 \"user message\" inputs with the type of binary (data) for our images.\n* Finally, we'll prompt our LLM with our testing criteria and capture the regressions detected.

This allows for much more accurate data extraction from the document especially when it comes to tables and complex layouts.\n\nMultimodal Parsing is better than traditiona OCR because:\n* It reduces complexity and overhead by avoiding the need to preprocess the document into text format such as markdown before passing to the LLM.\n* It handles non-standard PDF formats which may produce garbled output via traditional OCR text conversion.\n* It's orders of magnitude cheaper than premium OCR models that still require post-processing cleanup and formatting. LLMs can format to any schema or language you desire!\n\n## How it works\n\nYou can use the example bank statement created specifically for this workflow here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wS9U7MQDthj57CvEcqG_Llkr-ek6RqGA/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wS9U7MQDthj57CvEcqG_Llkr-ek6RqGA/view?usp=sharing)\n\n* A PDF bank statement is imported via Google Drive. For this demo, I've created a mock bank statement which includes complex table layouts of 5 columns. Typically, OCR will be unable to align the columns correctly and mistake some deposits for withdrawals.\n* Because multimodal LLMs do not accept PDFs directly, well have to convert the PDF to a series of images. We can achieve this by using a tool such as [Stirling PDF](https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF/). Stirling PDF is self-hostable which is handy for sensitive data such as bank statements.\n* Stirling PDF will return our PDF as a series of JPGs (one for each page) in a zipped file. We can use n8n's decompress node to extract the images and ensure they are ordered by using the Sort node.\n* Next, we'll resize each page using the Edit Image node to ensure the right balance between resolution limits and processing speed.\n* Each resized page image is then passed into the Basic LLM node which will use our multimodal LLM of choice - Gemini 1.5 Pro. In the LLM node's options, we'll add a \"user message\" of type binary (data) which is how we add our image data as an input.\n* Our prompt will instruct the multimodal LLM to transcribe each page to markdown. Note, you do not need to do this - you can just ask for data points to extract directly! Our goal for this template is to demonstrate the LLMs ability to accurately read the page.\n* Finally, with our markdown version of all pages, we can pass this to another LLM node to extract required data such as deposit line items.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Google Gemini API for Multimodal LLM.\n* Google Drive access for document storage.\n* [Stirling PDF](https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF) instance for PDF to Image conversion\n\n## Customising the workflow\n\n* At time of writing, Gemini 1.5 Pro is the most accurate in text document parsing with a relatively low cost. If you are not using Google Gemini however you can switch to other multimodal LLMs such as OpenAI GPT or Antrophic Claude. \n\n* If you don't need the markdown, simply asking what to extract directly in the LLM's prompt is also acceptable and would save a few extra steps.\n\n* Not parsing any bank statements any time soon? This template also works for Invoices, inventory lists, contracts, legal documents etc.","categories":[{"id":8,"name":"Finance"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":20,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.sort":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.editImage":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.compression":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatGoogleGemini":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.informationExtractor":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Jimleuk","username":"jimleuk","bio":"Freelance consultant based in the UK specialising in AI-powered automations.

It's easy to customize—add app nodes before the AI Agent step to pass additional context, or modify the Apple Shortcut to send inputs like text, geolocation, images, or files.\n\n![Siri Template Thumbnail](https://uploads.n8n.io/devrel/siri-template-thumb.png)\n\n### Set Up\nBasic instructions in template itself.\n\n### Requirements\n- **n8n account** (cloud or self-hosted)\n- **Apple Shortcuts app** on iOS or macOS. Dictation (\"Siri\") must be activated. Download the [Shortcuts template here](https://uploads.n8n.io/devrel/ask-agent-v1.shortcut).\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Voice-Controlled AI:** Trigger AI Agent via Siri for real-time voice replies.\n- **Customizable Inputs:** Modify Apple Shortcut to send text, images, geolocation, and more.\n- **Flexible Outputs:** Siri can return the AI’s response as text, files, or customize it to trigger CRUD actions in connected apps.\n- **Context-Aware:** Automatically feeds the current date and time to the AI Agent, with easy options to pass in more data.\n\n\n### How It Works:\n1. **Activate Siri** and speak your request.  \n2. Siri sends the transcribed text to the n8n workflow via Apple Shortcuts.  \n3. **AI Agent** processes the request and generates a response.  \n4. Siri reads the response, or the workflow can return geolocation, files, or even perform CRUD actions in apps.\n\n\n### Inspiration: Custom Use Cases\nTweak this template and make it your own.\n- **Capture Business Cards:** Snap a photo of a business card and record a voice note. Have the AI Agent draft a follow-up email in Gmail, ready to send.\n- **Voice-to-Task Automation:** Speak a new to-do item, and the workflow will add it to a Notion task board.\n- **Business English on the Fly:** Convert casual speech into polished business language, and save the refined text directly to your pasteboard, ready to be pasted into any app. \"It's late because of you\" -&gt; \"There has been a delay, and I believe your input may have contributed to it.\"\n\n","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":6,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Max Tkacz","username":"max-n8n","bio":"Principal Product Designer @ n8n","verified":true,"links":["https://n8n.io"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/c8f1965a9ff2bef51826e127081be880010ce5f0e3a3fc8ffd54e944d58bd2df?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2436,"template_name":"Siri AI Agent: Apple Shortcuts powered voice template","unique_visitors":2834,"unique_weekly_visitors":49,"unique_monthly_visitors":77,"unique_inserters":712,"unique_weekly_inserters":12,"unique_monthly_inserters":21},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2437","wf_detais":{"id":2437,"name":"Convert image to text using GROQ LLaVA V1.5 7B","createdAt":"2024-09-27T16:54:17.011Z","description":"## What this template does\nThis template uses GROQ LLAVA V1.5 7B API that offers fast inference for multimodal models with vision capabilities for understanding and interpreting visual data from images. .\n\nThe users send a image and get a description of the image from the model.\n\n## Setup\n- Open the Telegram app and search for the BotFather user (@BotFather)\n- Start a chat with the BotFather\n- Type /newbot to create a new bot\n- Follow the prompts to name your bot and get a unique API token\n- Save your access token and username\n- Once you set your bot, you can send the image, and get the descriptions.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegramTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"felipe biava cataneo","username":"felipecataneo","bio":"Engineer who likes to code as hobby","verified":false,"links":[""],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8c041ff6cc6d215ecd9033b0492456aac69765528401522577a110a78bc8eed9?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2437,"template_name":"Convert image to text using GROQ LLaVA V1.5 7B","unique_visitors":999,"unique_weekly_visitors":28,"unique_monthly_visitors":38,"unique_inserters":263,"unique_weekly_inserters":4,"unique_monthly_inserters":9},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2438","wf_detais":{"id":2438,"name":"Find out which Chrome extensions are tracked by Linkedin ","createdAt":"2024-09-28T07:17:35.065Z","description":"## What this workflow does\n**Linkedin tracks which Chrome extensions are installed in your browser.**  This workflow uses a huge raw JSON of chrome extension ids, extracted from Linkedin pages, and builds a pretty Google Sheet with the list of these extensions.

You can also connect the supervisor to your already existing Agents.\n\n## Demo & Explanation\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/qe23D1hgLwY/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/qe23D1hgLwY)\n\n## How it works\n- After recording a message in the Vagent App, it gets transcribed and sent in combination with a session ID to the registered webhook\n- The Main Agent acts as a router. I interprets the message while using the stored chat history (bound to the session ID) and chooses which tool to use to perform the required action and. Tools on this level are workflows, which contain subordinated Agents. Since the Main Agent interprets the original message, the raw input is passed to the Tools/Sub-Agents as a separate parameter\n- Within the Sub-Agents the actual processing takes place. Each of those has it’s separate chat memory (with a suffix to the main session ID), to achieve a clear separation of concerns\n- Depending on the required action an HTTP Request Tool is called. The result is being formatted in Markdown and returned to the Main Agent with an additional short prompt, so it does not get interpreted by the Main Agent.\n- Drafts are separated from a short message by added indentation (angle brackets). If some information is missing, no tool is called just yet, instead a message is returned back to the user\n- The Main Agent then outputs the result from the called Sub-Agent. If a draft is included, it gets separated from the spoken output\n- Finally the formatted output is returned as response to the webhook.

Then this n8n workflow in combination with an iOS shortcut will definitely help you. Once set up, you can use a shortcut, which can be stored as an app icon on your home screen, to record the start, end and duration of your break.\n\n## How it works\nOnce setup you can tap the iOS shortcut on your iPhone. You will see a menu containing three options: \"Track Start\", \"Track Break\" and \"Track End\". After time is tracked iOS will display you a notification about the successful operation.\n\n## How to set it up\n1. Copy the [notion database](https://unitize.notion.site/1117f2f5baf98054b33befb4d8a3c7ab?v=9b428f93c7d2451095728c1aeddbcb16) to your notion workspace (Top right corner).\n2. Copy the n8n workflow to your n8n workspace\n3. In the notion nodes in the n8n workflow, add your notion credentials and select the copied notion database.\n4. Download the iOS Shortcut from our [documentation page](https://unitize.notion.site/Time-Tracking-with-Notion-and-iOS-shortcut-1137f2f5baf9807f85fdf3f542da2427)\n5. Edit the shortcut and paste the url of your n8n Webhook trigger node to the first \"Text\" node of the iOS shortcut flow.\n6. It is a best practice to use authentication. You can do so by adding \"Header\" auth to the webhook node and to the shrotcut.\n\n---\n### You need help implementing this or any other n8n workflow?\nFeel free to contact me via LinkedIn or [my business website](https://www.nodemation.de).\n\n### You want to start using n8n?\nUse this link to [register for n8n](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/edr9c63lw12z)\n(This is an affiliate link)\n\n---\n","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":30,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":9},"n8n-nodes-base.notion":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"David","username":"unitize","bio":"You need help implementing a custom n8n workflow?\nFeel free to contact me via LinkedIn or my business website: unitize.de\n\nYou want to start using n8n?\nUse this affiliate link: https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/edr9c63lw12z","verified":false,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-moors-95b9061b5/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a9e5671c86ac556ed95d8c8f614afea1e67c3b09b507da53c15df3137b3910f8?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2447,"template_name":"Time Tracking with Notion and iOS shortcut","unique_visitors":210,"unique_weekly_visitors":7,"unique_monthly_visitors":9,"unique_inserters":29,"unique_weekly_inserters":2,"unique_monthly_inserters":2},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2448","wf_detais":{"id":2448,"name":"Masked Email Management for Fastmail","createdAt":"2024-10-02T18:03:32.846Z","description":"## Template Description\n\nThis n8n workflow is designed to manage Fastmail masked email addresses using the Fastmail API. The workflow provides the following functionalities:\n\n1. **Retrieve all masked emails**: Fetches all masked email addresses associated with the Fastmail account.\n2. **Create masked email**: Allows creating a new masked email with a specified state (`pending`, `enabled`, etc.).\n3. **Update masked email state**: Updates the state of a masked email such as enabling, disabling, or deleting it.\n4. **Generate HTML template**: Constructs an HTML table to display the masked emails in a user-friendly format.\n\n## Steps to Make it Work\n\n1. **Webhook Node**: \n   - This node listens for incoming requests to manage masked emails.\n   - Needs Basic Authentication credentials to secure the endpoint.\n\n2. **Session Node**: \n   - Sends a request to obtain session information from Fastmail's API.\n   - Requires an HTTP Header Auth credential with your Fastmail API token.\n\n3. **Switch Node**: \n   - Routes the workflow based on the state of the incoming masked email request (`pending`, `enabled`, `disabled`, `deleted`).\n   \n4. **HTTP Request Nodes**:\n   - These nodes handle various Fastmail API calls for masked emails (get, set, update, delete).\n   - All HTTP Request nodes require an HTTP Header Auth credential attached, using the Fastmail API token.\n\n5. **Set Node**: \n   - Gathers the retrieved masked email list into an array for further processing.\n\n6. **HTML Node**: \n   - Generates an HTML template to render the masked email addresses in a table format.\n\n7. **Respond to Webhook Node**: \n   - Sends back the HTML table to the client in response to the webhook request.\n\n### Needed Credentials\n\n1. **Fastmail Masked E-Mail Addresses**:\n   - An API token from Fastmail's API.\n   - Each HTTP call to Fastmail requires this credential for authentication.\n\n## Note\n\n- Ensure that you correctly configure authentication for the API calls and webhook security.\n- Use your actual Fastmail API credentials with the correct scope.\n- The workflow assumes that the Fastmail API is correctly configured and accessible from your n8n instance.\n- Update URLs and credentials IDs according to your n8n configuration.","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":11,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.html":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Vitali","username":"vquie","bio":"","verified":true,"links":[""],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/9547a27c5842ef984e096548285dc3d902bdecaad51c800b6f100a068a2fc9f0?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2448,"template_name":"Masked Email Management for Fastmail","unique_visitors":77,"unique_weekly_visitors":4,"unique_monthly_visitors":6,"unique_inserters":11,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":1},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2450","wf_detais":{"id":2450,"name":"One-way sync Stripe Invoice PDFs to a S3 Bucket","createdAt":"2024-10-04T22:05:26.222Z","description":"This automation syncs your Invoice PDFs from Stripe to a (AWS) S3 Bucket each month, in a folder of your choice, with the following subPath:\n\n*yourFolder/invoiceYear/invoiceMonth/fileName*\n\n\nFill in your **Credentials and Settings** in the Nodes marked with _\"*\"_.\n\nYou can adjust this Workflow to your needs.

While this workflow is production-ready if all steps are followed, adding error handling would enhance its robustness.\n\n## Important notes\n\n- **Check legal regulations**: This workflow involves scraping, so make sure to check the legal regulations around scraping in your country before getting started. Better safe than sorry!\n- **Mind those tokens**: OpenAI tokens can add up fast, so keep an eye on usage unless you want a surprising bill that could knock your socks off! 💸\n\n## Main Workflow\n\n### Node 1 - `Webhook`\nThis node triggers the workflow via a webhook call. You can replace it with any other trigger of your choice, such as form submission, a new row added in Google Sheets, or a manual trigger.\n\n### Node 2 - `Get Rows from Google Sheet`\nThis node retrieves the list of companies from your spreadsheet. The columns in this Google Sheet are:\n\n- **Company**: The name of the company\n- **Website**: The website URL of the company  \n  *These two fields are required at this step.*\n\n- **Business Area**: The business area deduced by OpenAI from the scraped data\n- **Offer**: The offer deduced by OpenAI from the scraped data\n- **Value Proposition**: The value proposition deduced by OpenAI from the scraped data\n- **Business Model**: The business model deduced by OpenAI from the scraped data\n- **ICP**: The Ideal Customer Profile deduced by OpenAI from the scraped data\n- **Additional Information**: Information related to the scraped data, including:\n  - **Information Sufficiency**:\n    - *Description*: Indicates if the information was sufficient to provide a full analysis.\n    - *Options*: \"Sufficient\" or \"Insufficient\"\n  - **Insufficient Details**:\n    - *Description*: If labeled \"Insufficient,\" specifies what information was missing or needed to complete the analysis.\n  - **Mismatched Content**:\n    - *Description*: Indicates whether the page content aligns with that of a typical company page.\n  - **Suggested Actions**:\n    - *Description*: Provides recommendations if the page content is insufficient or mismatched, such as verifying the URL or searching for alternative sources.\n\n### Node 3 - `Loop Over Items`\nThis node ensures that, in subsequent steps, the website in \"extra workflow input\" corresponds to the row being processed. You can delete this node, but you'll need to ensure that the \"query\" sent to the scraping workflow corresponds to the website of the specific company being scraped (rather than just the first row).\n\n### Node 4 - `AI Agent`\nThis AI agent is configured with a prompt to extract data from the content it receives. The node has three sub-nodes:\n  \n  - **OpenAI Chat Model**: The model used is currently `gpt4-o-mini`.\n  - **Call n8n Workflow**: This sub-node calls the workflow to use ScrapingBee and retrieves the scraped data.\n  - **Structured Output Parser**: This parser structures the output for clarity and ease of use, and then adds rows to the Google Sheet.\n\n### Node 5 - `Update Company Row in Google Sheet`\nThis node updates the specific company's row in Google Sheets with the enriched data.\n\n## Scraper Agent Workflow\n\n### Node 1 - `Tool Called from Agent`\nThis is the trigger for when the AI Agent calls the Scraper. A query is sent with:\n- Company name\n- Website (the URL of the website)\n\n### Node 2 - `Set Company URL`\nThis node renames a field, which may seem trivial but is useful for performing transformations on data received from the AI Agent.\n\n### Node 3 - `ScrapingBee: Scrape Company's Website`\nThis node scrapes data from the URL provided using ScrapingBee. You can use any scraper of your choice, but ScrapingBee is recommended, as it allows you to configure scraper behavior directly. Once configured, copy the provided \"curl\" command and import it into n8n.\n\n### Node 4 - `HTML to Markdown`\nThis node converts the scraped HTML data to Markdown, which is then sent to OpenAI. The Markdown format generally uses fewer tokens than HTML.\n\n## Improving the Workflow\nIt's always a pleasure to share workflows, but creators sometimes want to keep some magic to themselves ✨. Here are some ways you can enhance this workflow:\n\n- Handle potential errors\n- Configure the scraper tool to scrape other pages on the website. Although this will cost more tokens, it can be useful (e.g., scraping \"Pricing\" or \"About Us\" pages in addition to the homepage).\n- Instead of Google Sheets, connect directly to your CRM to enrich company data.\n- Trigger the workflow from form submissions on your website and send the scraped data about the lead to a Slack or Teams channel.\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":13,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.markdown":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolWorkflow":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserStructured":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Dataki","username":"dataki","bio":"I am passionate about transforming complex processes into seamless automations with n8n.

Wish you could filter through them quickly using AI but the decks are unparseable through conventional means? Then you're in luck!\n\nThis n8n template uses Multimodal LLMs to parse and extract valuable data from even the most overly designed pitch decks in quick fashion. Not only that, it'll also create the foundations of a RAG chatbot at the end so you or your colleagues can drill down into the details if needed. With this template, you'll scale your capacity to find interesting companies you'd otherwise miss!\n\n**Requires n8n v1.62.1+**\n\n## How It Works\n\n* Airtable is used as the pitch deck database and PDF decks are downloaded from it.\n* An AI Vision model is used to transcribe each page of the pitch deck into markdown.\n* An Information Extractor is used to generate a report from the transcribed markdown and update required information back into pitch deck database.\n* The transcribed markdown is also uploaded to a vector store to build an AI chatbot which can be used to ask questions on the pitch deck.\n\nCheck out the sample Airtable here: [https://airtable.com/appCkqc2jc3MoVqDO/shrS21vGqlnqzzNUc](https://airtable.com/appCkqc2jc3MoVqDO/shrS21vGqlnqzzNUc)\n\n### How To Use\n* This template depends on the availability of the Airtable - make a duplicate of the airtable ([link](https://airtable.com/appCkqc2jc3MoVqDO/shrS21vGqlnqzzNUc)) and its columns before running the workflow.\n* When a new pitchdeck is received, enter the company name into the **Name** column and upload the pdf into the **File** column. Leave all other columns blank.\n* If you have the Airtable trigger active, the execution should start immediately once the file is uploaded. Otherwise, click the manual test trigger to start the workflow.\n* When manually triggered, all \"new\" pitch decks will be handled by the workflow as separate executions.\n\n## Requirements\n* OpenAI for LLM\n* Airtable For Database and Interface\n* Qdrant for Vector Store\n\n## Customising This Workflow\n\n* Extend this starter template by adding more AI agents to validate claims made in the pitch deck eg.

The bot leverages OpenAI's assistant to interact with users and stores user data in Supabase for personalized conversations.\n\n### What problem does this workflow solve?\n\nMany simple chatbots lack context awareness and user memory. This workflow solves that by integrating Supabase to keep track of user sessions (via ```telegram_id``` and ```openai_thread_id```), allowing the bot to maintain continuity and context in conversations, leading to a more human-like and engaging experience.\n\n### What this workflow does\n\nThis Telegram bot template connects with OpenAI to answer user queries while storing and retrieving user information from a Supabase database. The memory component ensures that the bot can reference past interactions, making it suitable for use cases such as customer support, virtual assistants, or any application where context retention is crucial.\n\n1.**Receive New Message:** The bot listens for incoming messages from users in Telegram.\n2. **Check User in Database:** The workflow checks if the user is already in the Supabase database using the ```telegram_id```.\n3. **Create New User (if necessary):** If the user does not exist, a new record is created in Supabase with the telegram_id and a unique ```openai_thread_id```.\n4. **Start or Continue Conversation with OpenAI:** Based on the user’s context, the bot either creates a new thread or continues an existing one using the stored ```openai_thread_id```.\n5. **Merge Data:** User-specific data and conversation context are merged.\n6. **Send and Receive Messages:** The message is sent to OpenAI, and the response is received and processed.\n7. **Reply to User:** The bot sends OpenAI’s response back to the user in Telegram.\n\n\n### Setup\n\n1. **Create a Telegram Bot** using the [Botfather](https://t.me/botfather) and obtain the bot token.\n2. **Set up Supabase:**\n\t1. Create a new project and generate a ```SUPABASE_URL``` and ```SUPABASE_KEY```.\n\t2. Create a new table named ```telegram_users``` with the following SQL query:\n```\ncreate table\n  public.telegram_users (\n    id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid (),\n    date_created timestamp with time zone not null default (now() at time zone 'utc'::text),\n    telegram_id bigint null,\n    openai_thread_id text null,\n    constraint telegram_users_pkey primary key (id)\n  ) tablespace pg_default;\n```\n3. **OpenAI Setup:**\n\t1.

Under the hood, utilise n8n's powerful AI features to handle different message types and use an AI agent to respond to the user. A powerful tool for any use-case!\n\n## How it works\n* Incoming WhatsApp Trigger provides a way to get messages into the workflow.\n* The message received is extracted and sent through 1 of 4 branches for processing.\n* Each processing branch uses AI to analyse, summarize or transcribe the message so that the AI agent can understand it. The supported types are **text**, **image**, **audio (voice notes)** and **video (no sound)**.\n* The AI Agent is used to generate a response generally and uses a wikipedia tool for more complex queries.\n* Finally, the response message is sent back to the WhatsApp user using the WhatsApp node.\n\n## How to use\nOnce you have setup and configured your WhatsApp account, you'll need to activate your workflow to start processing messages.\n\n**Good to know:** Large media files may negatively impact workflow performance.\n\n## Requirements\n* WhatsApp Buisness account\n* OpenAI for LLM\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* For performance reasons, consider processing audio and video using dedicated services.\n* To handle videos with sound, you have 2 choices: use an LLM like Gemini which fully supports video processing (though video input is not currently supported in LLM node) or split the video into a image track and audio track and process separately.

This allows parallel processing.\n* A report is generated from the issue using its comment history allowing the issue to be classified by AI - determining the state and progress of the issue.\n* If determined to be resolved, sentiment analysis is performed to track customer satisfaction. If negative, a slack message is sent to escalate, otherwise the issue is closed automatically.\n* If no response has been initiated, an AI agent will attempt to search and resolve the issue itself using similar resolved issues or from the notion database. If a solution is found, it is posted to the issue and closed.\n* If the issue is blocked and waiting for responses, then a reminder message is added.\n\n## How to use\n\n* This template searches for JIRA issues which are older than 7 days which are not in the \"Done\" status. Ensure there are some issues that meet this criteria otherwise adjust the search query to suit.\n* Works best if you frequently have long-lived issues that need resolving.\n* Ensure the notion tool is configured as to not read documents you didn't intend it to ie. private and/or internal documentation.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* JIRA for issues management\n* OpenAI for LLM\n* Slack for notifications\n\n## Customising this workflow\n\n* Why not try classifying issues as they are created?

Due to a n8n limitation, this endpoint will have an additional code in the path (e.g. https://my.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/580ccc56-f308-4b64-961d-38323501a170/customers/:id). Keep this in mind when using these endpoints in your application\n- **Various Airtable nodes**: execute various specific operations to interact with Airtable records\n\n# Getting Started\n\nTo deploy and use this template:\n\n1. Import the workflow into your n8n workspace\n2. Customize the endpoint paths by tweaking the 'Path' parameters in the 'Webhook' and 'Webhook (with ID)' nodes (currently *customers*)\n3. Set up your Airtable credentials by following [this guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/) and customize the Airtable nodes by selecting your base, table, and the correct fields to update. *...or...* replace the Airtable nodes and connect the endpoint to any other service (e.g. Postgres, MySQL, Notion, Coda)\n\n\n# How to use the workflow\n\n1. Activate the workflow\n2. Connect your app to the endpoints (production URLs) to perform the various operations allowed by the workflow\n\nNote that the Webhook nodes have two URLs, one for testing and one for production. The testing URL is activated when you click on 'Test workflow' button and can't be used for production. The production URL is available after you activate the workflow.

Struggling to quickly identify the next big startup because these decks are too design-heavy for traditional parsing tools?\n\nYou’re in luck! This n8n template leverages multimodal LLMs to efficiently extract key information from even the most intricate pitch decks. Not only does it analyze content at scale, but it also builds the foundation for a RAG chatbot—so you and your team can explore deeper insights at any time. With this solution, you’ll never miss the hidden gems again!\n\n## Requirements\n- n8n v1.62.1+\n- OpenAI (for LLM)\n- Airtable (as the pitch deck database)\n- Qdrant (for the vector store)\n\n## How It Works\nAirtable serves as the pitch deck repository, where uploaded PDFs are stored.\nAn AI Vision model transcribes each PDF page into markdown.\nThe markdown is processed by an Information Extractor, which generates a summary and updates key fields in Airtable.\nThe markdown content is also indexed into Qdrant, creating a searchable AI chatbot that lets you interact with the pitch deck data.\n📋 Sample Airtable: View Example Here\n\n## How To Use\n1. Duplicate the Airtable: Use the template above to create your own Airtable with the same structure.\n2. Upload a Pitch Deck: Add the company name in the Name column and upload the PDF into the File column. Leave other fields blank.\n3. Trigger Workflow:\nIf the Airtable trigger is enabled, the workflow starts automatically when a new file is uploaded.\nYou can also manually trigger the workflow to process any \"new\" pitch decks in bulk.\nEach pitch deck will be processed individually in separate executions.\n\n## Customization Ideas\nEnhanced Validation: Add agents to verify claims from pitch decks (e.g., LinkedIn profiles, website traffic, product reviews).\nTailored Reports: Modify the extraction logic to generate customized reports for your accelerator’s needs.\nChatbot Extensions: Use the chatbot to compare multiple startups, filter based on specific criteria, or surface competitor insights.\nWith this template, you’ll scale your ability to uncover promising startups—turning overwhelming data into actionable insights in no time!","categories":[{"id":8,"name":"Finance"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":50,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.sort":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.airtable":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.editImage":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":11},"n8n-nodes-base.compression":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.airtableTool":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.convertToFile":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.airtableTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolVectorStore":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStoreQdrant":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.informationExtractor":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Abhishek Gupta","username":"codeforstartups","bio":"","verified":false,"links":["https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0126b8a691746e6696"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/dfbb0fff369350e7d6343ae4917b34a1fa14da52a6e997d9b8bf043bcb353e12?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2497,"template_name":"Streamline Your Pitch Deck Review with AI","unique_visitors":22,"unique_weekly_visitors":4,"unique_monthly_visitors":15,"unique_inserters":1,"unique_weekly_inserters":0,"unique_monthly_inserters":0},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2501","wf_detais":{"id":2501,"name":"Replace Images in Google Docs Documents and Download as PDF/Docx","createdAt":"2024-10-26T10:26:29.662Z","description":"## Use Case\nAutomate image replacement in Google Docs:\n- You need to update document images dynamically\n- You want to create multiple versions of a template with different images\n- You need to batch process document images from a URL database\n- You want to generate shareable documents with custom images\n\n## What this Workflow Does\nThe workflow automates image replacement in Google Docs:\n- Accepts image URLs from your database\n- Finds and replaces images in template documents\n- Creates new document copies with updated images\n- Optionally converts to PDF and makes documents shareable\n\n## Setup\n1.

Useful for internal linking.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Access to **Supabase** for storing embeddings.\n- Basic knowledge of **Postgres** and **pgvector**.\n- A **WordPress website** with content to be embedded.\n- An **OpenAI API key**\n- Ensure that your n8n workflow, Supabase instance, and WordPress website are set to the **same timezone** (or use GMT) for consistency.\n\n\n## Workflow 1 : Initial Embedding\n\nThis workflow retrieves your WordPress pages and posts, generates embeddings from the content, and stores them in Supabase using `pgvector`.\n\n### Step 0 : Create Supabase tables\n\n**Nodes :** \n- `Postgres - Create Documents Table`: This table is structured to support **OpenAI embedding** models with **1536 dimensions**\n- `Postgres - Create Workflow Execution History Table`\n\nThese two nodes create tables in Supabase:\n\n- The **documents** table, which stores embeddings of your website content.\n- The **n8n_website_embedding_histories** table, which logs workflow executions for efficient management of upserts. This table tracks the workflow execution ID and execution timestamp.\n\n### Step 1 : Retrieve and Merge WordPress Pages and Posts\n\n**Nodes :**\n- `WordPress - Get All Posts`\n- `WordPress - Get All Pages`\n- `Merge WordPress Posts and Pages`\n\nThese three nodes retrieve **all content and metadata from your posts and pages** and merge them. \n**Important: ** **Apply filters** to avoid generating embeddings for all site content.\n\n### Step 2 : Set Fields, Apply Filter, and Transform HTML to Markdown\n\n**Nodes :**\n- `Set Fields`\n- `Filter - Only Published & Unprotected Content`\n- `HTML to Markdown`\n\nThese three nodes prepare the content for embedding by:\n\n1. Setting up the necessary fields for content embeddings and document metadata.\n2. Filtering to include only **published** and **unprotected** content (`protected=false`), ensuring private or unpublished content is **excluded from your GenAI application**.\n3. Converting HTML to Markdown, which enhances **performance and relevance** in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by optimizing document embeddings.\n\n### Step 3: Generate Embeddings, Store Documents in Supabase, and Log Workflow Execution\n\n**Nodes**:\n- `Supabase Vector Store`\n  - **Sub-nodes**:\n    - `Embeddings OpenAI`\n    - `Default Data Loader`\n    - `Token Splitter`\n    - `Aggregate`\n- `Supabase - Store Workflow Execution`\n\nThis step involves generating embeddings for the content and storing it in Supabase, followed by logging the workflow execution details.\n\n1. **Generate Embeddings**: The `Embeddings OpenAI` node generates vector embeddings for the content.\n2. **Load Data**: The `Default Data Loader` prepares the content for embedding storage. The metadata stored includes the content title, publication date, modification date, URL, and **ID**, which is **essential for managing upserts**. \n\n\n⚠️ **Important Note :** Be cautious **not to store any sensitive information in metadata** fields, as this information will be **accessible to the AI and may appear in user-facing answers**.\n\n3. **Token Management**: The `Token Splitter` ensures that content is segmented into manageable sizes to comply with token limits.\n4. **Aggregate**: Ensure the last node is run only for 1 item.\n5. **Store Execution Details**: The `Supabase - Store Workflow Execution` node saves the workflow execution ID and timestamp, enabling tracking of when each content update was processed.\n\nThis setup **ensures that content embeddings are stored in Supabase for use in downstream applications**, while workflow execution details are logged for consistency and version tracking.\n\nThis workflow should be **executed only once for the initial embedding**. \n**Workflow 2**, described below, will **handle all future upserts**, ensuring that new or updated content is embedded as needed.\n\n## Workflow 2: Handle document upserts\n\n**Content on a website follows a lifecycle**—it may be **updated**, **new content** might be added, or, at times, content may be **deleted**. \n\nIn this **first version of the template**, the upsert workflow manages:\n- **Newly added content**\n- **Updated content**\n\n### Step 1: Retrieve WordPress Content with Regular CRON\n\n**Nodes**:\n- `CRON - Every 30 Seconds`\n- `Postgres - Get Last Workflow Execution`\n- `WordPress - Get Posts Modified After Last Workflow Execution`\n- `WordPress - Get Pages Modified After Last Workflow Execution`\n- `Merge Retrieved WordPress Posts and Pages`\n\nA **CRON job** (set to run **every 30 seconds** in this template, but you can **adjust it** as needed) initiates the workflow. A **Postgres SQL** query on the `n8n_website_embedding_histories` table retrieves the **timestamp** of the **latest workflow execution**.\n\nNext, the HTTP nodes use the **WordPress API** (**update the example URL** in the template with your own website’s URL and add your **WordPress credentials**) to request **all posts and pages modified after the last workflow execution date**. This process captures both **newly added** and **recently updated content**. The retrieved content is then merged for further processing.\n\n### Step 2 : Set fields, use filter\n\n**Nodes :**\n- `Set fields2`\n- `Filter - Only published and unprotected content`\n\nThe same that Step 2 in **Workflow 1**, except that HTML To Makrdown is used in further Step.\n\n### Step 3: Loop Over Items to Identify and Route Updated vs. Newly Added Content\n\n\n**Here, I initially aimed to use 'update documents' instead of the delete + insert approach, but encountered challenges, especially with updating both content and metadata columns together. Any help or suggestions are welcome! :)**\n\n\n**Nodes**:\n- `Loop Over Items`\n- `Postgres - Filter on Existing Documents`\n- `Switch`\n\n  - **Route `existing_documents`** (if documents with matching IDs are found in metadata):\n    - `Supabase - Delete Row if Document Exists`: Removes any existing entry for the document, preparing for an update.\n    - `Aggregate2`: Used to aggregate documents on Supabase with ID to ensure that `Set Fields3` is executed only once for each WordPress content to **avoid duplicate execution**.\n    - `Set Fields3`: Sets fields required for embedding updates.\n    \n  - **Route `new_documents`** (if no matching documents are found with IDs in metadata):\n    - `Set Fields4`: Configures fields for embedding newly added content.\n\n\nIn this step, a loop processes **each item**, directing it based on **whether the document already exists**. The **`Aggregate2`** node acts as a control to ensure `Set Fields3` runs only once per WordPress content, effectively **avoiding duplicate execution** and optimizing the update process.\n\n\n### Step 4 : HTML to Markdown, Supabase Vector Store, Update Workflow Execution Table\n\nThe **HTML to Markdown** node mirrors **Workflow 1 - Step 2**. Refer to that section for a detailed explanation on how HTML content is converted to Markdown for improved embedding performance and relevance.\n\nFollowing this, the content is **stored in the Supabase vector store** to manage embeddings efficiently. Lastly, the **workflow execution table is updated. These nodes mirros the **Workflow 1 - Step 3 nodes**.\n\n## Workflow 3 : An example of GenAI App with Wordpress Content : Chatbot to be embed on your website\n\n### Step 1: Retrieve Supabase Documents, Aggregate, and Set Fields After a Chat Input\n\n**Nodes**:\n- `When Chat Message Received`\n- `Supabase - Retrieve Documents from Chat Input`\n- `Embeddings OpenAI1`\n- `Aggregate Documents`\n- `Set Fields`\n\n\nWhen a user sends a message to the chat, the prompt (user question) is sent to the Supabase vector store retriever. The RPC function `match_documents` (created in **Workflow 1 - Step 0**) retrieves documents relevant to the user’s question, enabling a more accurate and relevant response.\n\nIn this step:\n1. The **Supabase vector store retriever** fetches documents that match the user’s question, including metadata.\n2. The **Aggregate Documents** node consolidates the retrieved data.\n3. Finally, **Set Fields** organizes the data to create a more readable input for the AI agent.\n\n**Directly using the AI agent** without these nodes would prevent metadata from being sent to the language model (LLM), but **metadata is essential for enhancing the context** and accuracy of the AI’s response. By including metadata, the **AI’s answers can reference relevant document details, making the interaction more informative**.\n\n### Step 2: Call AI Agent, Respond to User, and Store Chat Conversation History\n\n**Nodes**:\n- **AI Agent**\n  - Sub-nodes:\n    - `OpenAI Chat Model`\n    - `Postgres Chat Memories`\n- **Respond to Webhook**\n\nThis step involves calling the AI agent to generate an answer, responding to the user, and storing the conversation history.  The model used is **gpt4-o-mini**, chosen for its cost-efficiency.

The matching happens between the names (because one workflow can contain different credentials of the same type) of the original credentials and the ones available on the current instance. Every option then shows all available credentials of the same type. In addition the user has always the choice to create a new credential on the fly.\n- For every option which was set to create a new credential, an empty credential is being created on the current instance using the n8n API. An emoji is being appended to the name, which indicates that it needs to be populated.\n- Finally the workflow gets updated with the new credential ID’s and created on the current instance using the n8n API. Then the user gets a message, if the process has succeeded or not.\n\n## Setup\n\n- Select your credentials in the nodes which require those\n- Configure your remote instance(s) in the Settings node. (You can skip this step, if you only want to use the File Upload feature)\n    - Every instance is defined as object with the keys *name*, *apiKey* and *baseUrl*. Those instances are then wrapped inside an array. You can find an example described within a note on the workflow canvas.\n\n## How to use\n\n- Grab the (production) URL of the Form from the first node\n- Open the URL and follow the instructions given in the multi-form\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n- Security: Beware, that all credentials are being decrypted and processed within the workflow. Also the API keys to other n8n instances are stored within the workflow.\n- This solution is primarily meant for transferring data between testing environments. For production use consider the n8n enterprise edition which provides a **reliable** way to deploy workflows between different environments without the need of manual credential mapping.","categories":[{"id":11,"name":"Other"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":58,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.n8n":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.form":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.sort":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.renameKeys":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":21},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.removeDuplicates":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Mario","username":"octionic","bio":"Workflow Optimization Expert | Software Architect.

To achieve this, SQL queries are made outside the AI Agent node, and the results are never passed back to the agent.\n\nThis approach allows the agent to generate SQL queries based on the structure of tables and their relationships, without having to access the actual data.\n\nThis makes the process more secure and efficient, especially in cases where data confidentiality is crucial.\n\n### 🚀 Setup\n\nTo get started with this workflow, you’ll need to set up a free MySQL server and import your database (check Step 1 and 2 [in this tutorial](https://blog.n8n.io/compare-databases/)). \n\n*Of course, you can switch MySQL to another SQL database such as PostgreSQL, the principle remains the same. The key is to download the schema once and save it locally to avoid repeated remote connections.*\n\nRun the top part of the workflow once to download and store the MySQL chinook database schema file on the server.\n\nWith this approach, we avoid the need to repeatedly connect to a remote db4free database and fetch the schema every time. As a result, we reach greater processing speed and efficiency.\n\n### 🗣️ Chat with your data\n\n1. Start a chat: send a message in the chat window.\n2. The workflow loads the locally saved MySQL database schema, without having the ability to touch the actual data. The file contains the full structure of your MySQL database for analysis.\n3. The Langchain AI Agent receives the schema, your input and begins to work.\n4. The AI Agent generates SQL queries and brief comments based solely on the schema and the user’s message.\n5. An IF node checks whether the AI Agent has generated a query. When:\n- Yes: the AI Agent passes the SQL query to the next MySQL node for execution.\n- No: You get a direct answer from the Agent without further action.\n\n6. The workflow formats the results of the SQL query, ensuring they are convenient to read and easy to understand.\n7. Once formatted, you get both the Agent answer and the query result in the chat window.\n\n### 🌟 Example queries\n\nTry these sample queries to see the schema-driven AI Agent in action:\n\n1.  Would you please list me all customers from Germany?\n\n2.  What are the music genres in the database?\n\n3. What tables are available in the database?\n\n4. Please describe the relationships between tables. - In this example, the AI Agent does not need to create the SQL query.\n\nAnd if you prefer to keep the data private, you can manually execute the generated SQL query in your own environment using any database client or tool you trust 🗄️\n\n💭 The AI Agent memory node does not store the actual data as we run SQL-queries outside the agent. It contains the database schema, user questions and the initial Agent reply. Actual SQL query results are passed to the chat window, but the values are not stored in the Agent memory.\n","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":29,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.mySql":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":9},"n8n-nodes-base.convertToFile":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Yulia","username":"yulia","bio":"Let's connect!

This is especially useful for generating disposable email addresses for privacy-conscious users or for testing purposes.\n\n#### Workflow Details:\n1. **Webhook Trigger**: The workflow is initiated by sending a POST request to a specific webhook. You can include `state` and `description` in your request body to customize the masked email's state and description.\n2. **Session Retrieval**: The workflow makes an HTTP request to the Fastmail API to retrieve session information. It uses this data to authenticate further requests.\n3. **Create Masked Email**: Using the retrieved session data, the workflow sends a POST request to Fastmail's JMAP API to create a masked email. It uses the provided state and description from the webhook payload.\n4. **Prepare Output**: Once the masked email is successfully created, the workflow extracts the email address and attaches the description for further processing.\n5. **Respond to Webhook**: Finally, the workflow responds to the original POST request with the newly created masked email and its description.\n\n#### Requirements:\n- **Fastmail API Access**: You will need valid API credentials for Fastmail configured with HTTP Header Authentication.\n- **Authorization Setup**: Optionally set up authorization if your webhook is exposed to the internet to prevent misuse.\n- **Custom Webhook Request**: Use a tool like `curl` or create a shortcut on macOS/iOS to send the POST request to the webhook with the necessary JSON payload, like so:\n  \n  ```bash\n  curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://your-n8n-instance/webhook/87f9abd1-2c9b-4d1f-8c7f-2261f4698c3c -d '{\"state\": \"pending\", \"description\": \"my mega fancy masked email\"}'\n  ```\n\nThis template simplifies the process of integrating masked email functionality into your projects or workflows and can be extended for various use cases.\n\nFeel free to use the companion shortcut I've also created.

It is triggered when someone fills out the modal popup in slack generated by the `Qualys Slack Shortcut Bot`.\n\nWhen deploying this workflow, use the Demo Data node to simulate the data that is input via the Execute Workflow Trigger. That data flows into the Global Variables Node which is then referenced by the rest of the workflow. \n\nIt includes nodes to Fetch the Report IDs and then Launch a report, and then check the report status periodically and download the completed report, which is then posted to Slack for easy access. \n\nFor Security Operations Centers (SOCs), this workflow provides significant benefits by automating tedious tasks, ensuring timely updates, and facilitating efficient data handling.\n\n## How It Works\n\n- **Fetch Report Templates:** The \"Fetch Report IDs\" node retrieves a list of available report templates from Qualys. This automated retrieval saves time and ensures that the latest templates are used, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of reports.\n  \n- **Convert XML to JSON:** The response is converted to JSON format for easier manipulation. This step simplifies data handling, making it easier for SOC analysts to work with the data and integrate it into other tools or processes.\n  \n- **Launch Report:** A POST request is sent to Qualys to initiate report generation using specified parameters like template ID and report title. Automating this step ensures consistency and reduces the chance of human error, improving the reliability of the reports generated.\n  \n- **Loop and Check Status:** The workflow loops every minute to check if the report generation is complete. Continuous monitoring automates the waiting process, freeing up SOC analysts to focus on higher-priority tasks while ensuring they are promptly notified when reports are ready.\n  \n- **Download Report:** Once the report is ready, it is downloaded from Qualys. Automated downloading ensures that the latest data is always available without manual intervention, improving efficiency.\n  \n- **Post to Slack:** The final report is posted to a designated Slack channel for quick access. This integration with Slack ensures that the team can promptly access and review the reports, facilitating swift action and decision-making.\n\n\n## Get Started\n\n- Ensure your [Slack](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=node_settings_modal-credential_link&utm_campaign=n8n-nodes-base.slack) and [Qualys](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=node_settings_modal-credential_link&utm_campaign=n8n-creds-base.qualysApi) integrations are properly set up.\n- Customize the workflow to fit your specific reporting needs.\n- Link to parent workflow\n\n\n## Need Help?\n\n- Join the discussion on our Forum or check out resources on Discord!\n\n\nDeploy this workflow to streamline your security report generation process, improve response times, and enhance the efficiency of your security operations.","categories":[{"id":29,"name":"SecOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":22,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.xml":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Angel Menendez","username":"djangelic","bio":"Angel Menendez is a Staff Developer Advocate at n8n.io, specializing in low-code tools for cybersecurity workflows.

It ensures your droplet snapshots stay organized and within a manageable limit, preventing unnecessary storage costs due to an excess of snapshots.\n\n### Who is this for?\nThis workflow is perfect for users managing DigitalOcean Droplets and looking to automate the process of snapshot creation and cleanup to save on storage costs and maintain efficient resource management. It’s useful for DevOps teams, cloud administrators, or any developer leveraging DigitalOcean for their infrastructure.\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving?\nWhen managing multiple DigitalOcean Droplets, snapshots can quickly accumulate, taking up space and increasing storage costs. Manually deleting and creating snapshots can be time-consuming and inefficient. This automation solves this problem by automating the snapshot management process, ensuring that no more than a defined number of snapshots are kept per droplet.\n\n### What this workflow does\n1. **Runs every 48 hours**: The workflow is triggered by a cron node that runs every 48 hours, ensuring timely snapshot management.\n2. **List all droplets**: The workflow retrieves all droplets in the DigitalOcean account.\n3. **Retrieve snapshots**: For each droplet, the workflow retrieves a list of existing snapshots.\n4. **Filter snapshots**: If the number of snapshots exceeds 4, the workflow filters for snapshots that need to be deleted.\n5. **Delete snapshots**: Excess snapshots are automatically deleted based on the filter criteria.\n6. **Create new snapshot**: After cleaning up, the workflow creates a new snapshot for each droplet, ensuring that backups are always up-to-date.\n\n### Setup\n1. **DigitalOcean API Key**: You’ll need to configure the HTTP Request nodes with your DigitalOcean API key. This key is required for authenticating requests to list droplets, retrieve snapshots, delete snapshots, and create new ones.\n2. **Snapshot Threshold**: By default, the workflow is set to keep no more than 4 snapshots per droplet. This can be adjusted by modifying the filter node conditions.\n3. **Set Execution Frequency**: The cron node is set to run every 48 hours, but you can adjust the timing to suit your needs.\n\n### How to customize this workflow\n- **Adjust Snapshot Limit**: Change the value in the filter node if you want to keep more or fewer snapshots.\n- **Modify Run Frequency**: The workflow runs every 48 hours by default. You can change the frequency in the cron node to run more or less often.\n- **Enhance with Notifications**: You can add a notification node (e.g., Slack or email) to alert you when snapshots are deleted or created.\n\n### Workflow Summary\nThis workflow automates the management of DigitalOcean Droplet snapshots by keeping the number of snapshots under a defined limit, deleting the oldest ones, and ensuring new snapshots are created at regular intervals.\n","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":17,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.cron":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":11},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4}}}},"user":{"name":"Darryn","username":"optimus01","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["http://onlinethinking.io/community/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/7c20cc4f6cea0480e0e7d58353274476e195d6ec8926a3a6709bb217e7f03713?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2485,"template_name":"Automate Droplet Snapshots on DigitalOcean","unique_visitors":64,"unique_weekly_visitors":2,"unique_monthly_visitors":3,"unique_inserters":9,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":1},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2520","wf_detais":{"id":2520,"name":"Summarize Umami data with AI (via Openrouter) and save it to Baserow","createdAt":"2024-11-02T07:13:06.199Z","description":"## Who's this for?\n- Anyone who wants to improve the SEO of their website\n- Umami users who want insights on how to improve their site\n- SEO managers who need to generate reports weekly\n\n![Screenshot 20241102 at 3.00.47 PM.png](fileId:859)![Screenshot 20241102 at 3.01.13 PM.png](fileId:860)\n\n## Case study\n\nYou can [read more about how this works here.](https://rumjahn.com/how-to-analyze-umami-data-using-n8n-and-a-i-to-improve-seo-and-uncover-hidden-insights-for-better-content-optimization/)\n\n\n## How it works\n- This workflow calls the Umami API to get data \n- Then it sends the data to A.I. for analysis\n- It saves the data and analysis to Baserow\n\n## How to use this\n- Input your Umami credentials\n- Input your website property ID\n- Input your Openrouter.ai credentials\n- Input your baserow credentials\n- You will need to create a baserow database with columns: Date, Summary, Top Pages, Blog (name of your blog).\n\n## Future development\n- Use this as a template.

A final form ending indicates if that action succeeded or not.\n\n## Setup\n\n- Select your credentials in the nodes which require those\n- Configure your remote instance(s) in the Settings node\n    - Every instance is defined as object with the keys *name*, *apiKey* and *baseUrl*. Those instances are then wrapped inside an array. You can find an example described within a note on the workflow canvas.\n\n## How to use\n\n- Grab the (production) URL of the Form from the first node\n- Open the URL and follow the instructions given in the multi-form\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n- Please note, that this workflow can only run on self-hosted n8n instances, since it requires the Execute Command Node.\n- Security: Beware, that all credentials are being decrypted and processed within the workflow. Also the API keys to other n8n instances are stored within the workflow.\n- This solution is primarily meant for transferring data between testing environments.

It runs every hour to ensure continuous monitoring and up-to-date vulnerability management, making it ideal for Security Operations Centers (SOCs).\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n- **Set Global Variables:** Initializes necessary global variables like `base_url` and `newtimestamp`. This step ensures that the workflow operates with the correct configuration and up-to-date timestamps. Ensure to change the `Global Variables` to match your environment. \n  \n- **Fetch Reports from Qualys:** Sends a GET request to the Qualys API to retrieve finished reports. Automating this step ensures timely updates and consistent data retrieval.\n  \n- **Convert XML to JSON:** Converts the XML response to JSON format for easier data manipulation. This transformation simplifies further processing and integration into TheHive.\n  \n- **Filter Reports:** Checks if the reports have already been processed using their creation timestamps. This filtering ensures that only new reports are handled, avoiding duplicates.\n  \n- **Process Each Report:** Loops through the list of new reports, ensuring each is processed individually. This step-by-step handling prevents issues related to bulk processing and improves reliability.\n  \n- **Create Case in TheHive:** Generates a new case in TheHive for each report, serving as a container for the report data. Automating case creation improves efficiency and ensures that all relevant data is captured.\n  \n- **Download and Attach Report:** Downloads the report from Qualys and attaches it to the respective case in TheHive. This automation ensures that all data is properly archived and easily accessible for review.\n\n\n**Get Started:**\n\n- Ensure your [Qualys](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=node_settings_modal-credential_link&utm_campaign=n8n-creds-base.qualysApi) and [TheHive](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.thehiveproject/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=node_settings_modal-credential_link&utm_campaign=n8n-nodes-base.theHiveProject) integrations are properly set up.\n- Customize the workflow to fit your specific vulnerability management needs.\n\n\n**Need Help?**\n\n- Join the discussion on our Forum or check out resources on Discord!\n\n\nDeploy this workflow to streamline your vulnerability management process, improve response times, and enhance the efficiency of your security operations.","categories":[{"id":29,"name":"SecOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":23,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.n8n":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.xml":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.theHiveProject":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Angel Menendez","username":"djangelic","bio":"Angel Menendez is a Staff Developer Advocate at n8n.io, specializing in low-code tools for cybersecurity workflows.

Normally sub-workflows would need to be run synchronously, in series, or, if they are executed asynchronously (to run concurrently, in parallel), there is no easy way to merge/wait for an arbitrary number of them to complete.\n\nThis is a \"design pattern\" template to show one approach for running multiple, data-driven instances of a sub-workflow \"asynchronously,\" in parallel (instead of running them one at a time in series), but still prevent the later steps in the workflow from continuing until all of the sub-workflows have reported back that they are finished, via callback URL.  There are other techniques involving messaging services, database tables, or other external \"flow manager\" helpers, but this technique accomplishes the goal fully within n8n.\n\n## Setup\nTo implement this pattern, examine the nodes in the template and modify the incoming data leading to:\n1. A split-out loop to acynchronously execute a sub-workflow multiple times, in parallel.\n    * For instance, each sub-workflow might process one of a list of incoming documents.\n    * The resumeUrl for the main/parent workflow is provided to all of the sub-workflow executions, along with a unique identifier that can be counted later (e.g. a document file-name).\n2. A \"wait-for-all\" loop that checks whether all sub-workflows have reported back (`if` node) and builds a unique list of identifiers from the callbacks received from each execution of the sub-workflow.\n    * The sub-workflow should be designed to respond immediately (async) and later send a callback request when it has finished processing.\n    * The callback request should include the unique identifier value received when the sub-workflow it was started.\n\nThis is meant to be a possible answer to questions like [this one about running things in parallel](https://community.n8n.io/t/is-it-possible-to-run-a-part-of-the-workflow-in-parallel/60221),  maybe [this one about waiting for things to finish](https://community.n8n.io/t/node-does-not-wait-for-predecessor-node-always-need-a-merge-node/60773), [this one about managing sub-batches of things by waiting for each batch](https://community.n8n.io/t/maximum-parallel-subworkflows/60052), or [this one about running things in parallel](https://community.n8n.io/t/parallel-execution-of-bat-files/49493).

It is ideal for anyone looking to streamline their social media posting process, saving time and ensuring consistent content delivery.\n\n## Use Case / Problem Solved\nManually posting images and captions on Instagram can be time-consuming, especially for businesses and content creators managing multiple accounts. This workflow automates the process from image preparation to publishing, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.\n\n## What this workflow does\n1. **Trigger Initialization**: The workflow starts with a manual trigger that can be adapted to other triggers (e.g., HTTP webhook or schedule).\n2. **Set Parameters**: The workflow includes a node that sets essential parameters, such as the image URL, Instagram business account ID, and caption.\n3. **Prepare Instagram Media**: A node prepares the media for upload using the Facebook API, sending the image and caption for pre-publication processing.\n4. **Check Media Upload Status**: The workflow verifies if the media preparation is complete.\n5. **Conditional Check**: If the media preparation is successful, the workflow proceeds to publish; otherwise, it triggers an error-handling path.\n6. **Publish Media**: The media is published on Instagram if the conditions are met.\n7. **Post-Publish Check**: The workflow checks the status after publication.\n8. **Conditional Check for Publication**: If the publication status is \"PUBLISHED,\" it triggers a success path; otherwise, it triggers a failure handling.\n9. **Email Notifications**: The workflow sends email notifications to indicate successful or unsuccessful outcomes.\n\n## Setup \n\nHere is a quick video in italian language with sub eng(https://youtu.be/obWJFJvg_6g)\n\n1. **Add API Credentials**: Ensure that valid Facebook API credentials are added and configured for use.\n2. **Permissions Required**: Ensure your app has the necessary permissions (`ads_management`, `business_management`, `instagram_basic`, `instagram_content_publish`, `pages_read_engagement`). App review may be required for external user access.\n3. **Node Configuration**: Customize the `Set Instagram Parameters` node to specify the image URL, caption, and Instagram business account ID.\n4. **Trigger Adaptation**: Adapt the initial trigger if needed to fit your workflow's requirements (e.g., schedule, webhook).\n\n## How to customize this workflow\n- **Change the Image URL and Caption**: Modify the `Set Instagram Parameters` node to change the image and caption.\n- **Trigger Customization**: Replace the manual trigger with other triggers like a webhook to automate posting based on external events.\n- **Notifications**: Adjust the email nodes to send customized messages or trigger other workflows based on the outcome.\n\n## Limitations\n- **Image Format**: Only JPEG images are supported. Extended JPEG formats such as MPO and JPS are not compatible.\n- **Unsupported Tags**: Shopping tags, branded content tags, and filters are not supported.\n- **Instagram TV**: Publishing to Instagram TV is not supported.\n- **Rate Limit**: Instagram accounts are limited to 50 API-published posts within a rolling 24-hour period. Carousels count as a single post. Check usage with `GET /{ig-user-id}/content_publishing_limit`.\n\n### Example Usage\nImagine managing a business account that needs consistent posts. You can schedule this workflow or trigger it manually to automatically post images with captions at the right time, ensuring that your audience stays engaged without manual posting efforts.","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":21,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.emailSend":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":9},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.facebookGraphApi":{"count":5}}}},"user":{"name":"Edoardo Guzzi","username":"mredodos","bio":"Automation expert with 10+ years in programming, AI, Chrome extensions, and mobile apps.

It ensures that failed API requests are retried with increasing delays, up to a specified maximum retry count. This approach helps mitigate transient errors (e.g., rate limits or temporary network issues) while maintaining workflow efficiency.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Exponential Backoff Logic**: Dynamically increases wait time between retries based on the retry count.\n- **Error Handling**: Stops the workflow and raises an error after a specified number of retries.\n- **Dynamic Waiting**: Waits for a calculated duration before each retry.\n- **Scalable Design**: Modular nodes for easy debugging and customization.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow Details\n\n### Nodes in the Workflow:\n\n1. **Trigger** (`When clicking \"Test Workflow\"`):\n   - Manually starts the workflow for testing.\n\n2. **Loop Over Items**:\n   - Iterates over multiple input items to process Google API requests row by row.\n\n3. **Google API Node (Example: Update Sheet)**:\n   - Sends a request to a Google API endpoint (e.g., updating a row in Google Sheets).\n   - On success: Moves to the next item in the loop.\n   - On error: Passes the error to the **Exponential Backoff** node.\n\n4. **Exponential Backoff**:\n   - Calculates the delay for the next retry based on the retry count.\n   - Logic:\n     ```javascript\n     const retryCount = $json[\"retryCount\"] || 0;\n     const maxRetries = 5;\n     const initialDelay = 1; // in seconds\n\n     if (retryCount &lt; maxRetries) {\n         const currentDelayInSeconds = initialDelay * Math.pow(2, retryCount);\n         return {\n             json: {\n                 retryCount: retryCount + 1,\n                 waitTimeInSeconds: currentDelayInSeconds,\n                 status: 'retrying',\n             }\n         };\n     } else {\n         return {\n             json: {\n                 error: 'Max retries exceeded',\n                 retryCount: retryCount,\n                 status: 'failed'\n             }\n         };\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Wait**:\n   - Dynamically waits for the `waitTimeInSeconds` value calculated in the Exponential Backoff node.\n   - **Configuration:**\n     - Resume: `After Time Interval`\n     - Wait Amount: `{{ $json[\"waitTimeInSeconds\"] }}`\n     - Unit: `Seconds`\n\n6. **Check Max Retries**:\n   - Evaluates whether the retry count has exceeded the maximum limit.\n   - Routes the workflow:\n     - **True**: Passes to the **Stop and Error** node.\n     - **False**: Loops back to the Google API node for retry.\n\n7. **Stop and Error**:\n   - Stops the workflow and logs the error when the maximum retry count is reached.\n\n---\n\n## Parameters\n### Configurable Settings:\n1. **Max Retries**:\n   - Defined in the Exponential Backoff node (`const maxRetries = 5`).\n   - Adjust this value based on your requirements.\n\n2. **Initial Delay**:\n   - The starting wait time for retries, defined as `1` second.\n\n3. **Google API Configuration**:\n   - Ensure your Google API node is properly authenticated and configured with the desired endpoint and parameters.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use\n1. **Import the Workflow**:\n   - Copy the workflow JSON and import it into your n8n instance.\n\n2. **Configure Google API Node**:\n   - Set up the Google API node with your credentials and target API endpoint (e.g., Google Sheets, Gmail, etc.).\n\n3. **Test the Workflow**:\n   - Manually trigger the workflow and observe the retry behavior in case of errors.\n\n4. **Monitor Logs**:\n   - Use the console logs in the Exponential Backoff node to debug retry timings and status.\n\n---\n\n## Example Scenarios\n### Scenario 1: Successful Execution\n- The Google API processes all requests without errors.\n- Workflow completes without triggering the retry logic.\n\n### Scenario 2: Transient API Errors\n- The Google API returns an error (e.g., `429 Too Many Requests`).\n- The workflow retries the request with increasing wait times.\n\n### Scenario 3: Maximum Retries Exceeded\n- The workflow reaches the maximum retry count (e.g., 5 retries).\n- An error is raised, and the workflow stops.\n\n---\n\n## Considerations\n1. **Jitter**:\n   - This workflow does not implement jitter (randomized delay) since it's not required for low-volume use cases.\n   - If needed, jitter can be added to the exponential backoff calculation.\n\n2. **Retry Storms**:\n   - If multiple workflows run simultaneously, ensure your API quotas can handle potential retries.\n\n3. **Error Handling Beyond Max Retries**:\n   - Customize the **Stop and Error** node to notify stakeholders or log errors in a centralized system.\n\n---\n\n## Customization Options\n- Adjust the maximum retry limit and delay calculation to suit your use case.\n- Add additional logic to handle specific error codes differently.\n- Extend the workflow to notify stakeholders when an error occurs (e.g., via Slack or email).\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n- **Retry Not Triggering**:\n  - Ensure the `retryCount` variable is passed correctly between nodes.\n  - Confirm that the error output from the Google API node flows to the Exponential Backoff node.\n\n- **Incorrect Wait Time**:\n  - Verify the `Wait` node is referencing the correct field for `waitTimeInSeconds`.\n\n---\n\n## Request for Feedback\nWe are always looking to improve this workflow. If you have suggestions, improvements, or ideas for additional features, please feel free to share them. Your feedback helps us refine and enhance this solution!\n\n","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stopAndError":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Alex Kim","username":"alexk1919","bio":"AI-Native Workflow Automation Architect || n8n Ambassador\n\nWith decades of entrepreneurial experience, I specialize in designing and building enterprise-grade smart workflow automations that drive efficiency and scalability across industries and departments.

It is sent back to the AI Agent.\n\n## How to use it\n- Use an existing or create a new database.\n- For example, I've used [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/coffee-sales/versions/15?resource=download) and uploaded it to a Supabase DB.\n- Add the PostgreSQL or MySQL credentials.\n- Alternatively, you can use SQLite binary files (check [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2292-talk-to-your-sqlite-database-with-a-langchain-ai-agent/)).\n- Activate the workflow.\n- Start chatting with the AI SQL Agent.\n- If the Text Classifier considers a chart would be useful, it will generate a chart in addition to the response from the SQL Agent.\n\n## Notes\n- The full Quickchart.io specifications have not been integrated, thus there are some possible glitches (e.g., due to the size of the graph, radar graphs are not displayed properly).","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":16,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textClassifier":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Agent Studio","username":"agentstudio","bio":"We are a product studio that helps organizations leverage no-code and generative AI to automate internal processes and launch new digital products.","verified":true,"links":["https://agentstudio.io/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e9cf0d0fccead46655b11b2ce215cf14d33ecdaa2ce52828f003574c1800e77a?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2559,"template_name":"Visualize your SQL Agent queries with OpenAI and Quickchart.io","unique_visitors":992,"unique_weekly_visitors":109,"unique_monthly_visitors":173,"unique_inserters":139,"unique_weekly_inserters":16,"unique_monthly_inserters":23},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2525","wf_detais":{"id":2525,"name":"Create Content from Form Inputs and Save it to Google Drive using AI","createdAt":"2024-11-04T20:00:09.023Z","description":"# AI Content Generator Workflow\n\n## **Introduction**\nThis workflow automates the process of creating high-quality articles using AI, organizing them in Google Drive, and tracking their progress in Google Sheets.

It is ideal for anyone looking to streamline their social media posting process, saving time and ensuring consistent content delivery.\n\n## Use Case / Problem Solved\nManually posting images and captions on Instagram can be time-consuming, especially for businesses and content creators managing multiple accounts. This workflow automates the process from image preparation to publishing, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.\n\n## What this workflow does\n1. Trigger Initialization: The workflow starts with a manual trigger that can be adapted to other triggers (e.g., HTTP webhook or schedule).\n2. Set Parameters: The workflow includes a node that sets essential parameters, such as the Bluesky account ID, image URLs, and caption.\n3. Prepare Bluesky Session: A node creates the authenticated session data used by the upload and post operations later in the workflow.\n4. Publish Media: Nodes retrieve image files from the specified URLS and uploads them as blobs to Bluesky, a necessary pre-requisite for a Bluesky post to have images attached.\n5. Post text caption + images: A node does the final call to the Bluesky API, including the text caption and relevant image references.\n\n## Setup\n1. Sign-in to Bluesky and create an [App Password](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords)\n2. Add your username and App Password to the *Define Credentials* node.\n3. Set the caption (text content) of your post in the *Set Caption* node.\n4. Set 1-4 image URLs in the *Set Images* node\n5. Adapt the initial trigger as needed to fit your workflow's requirements (e.g., schedule, webhook). \n6. Adapt the caption and images nodes to accept dynamic parameters.\n\n## Limitations\nThis workflow assumes a minimum of 1 image URL to function. If you want a text-only post, remove the whole `embed` section from the JSON in last *Post to Bluesky* node, as well as relevant image attachment nodes.\n\nThe 300-character limit in Bluesky includes the caption + hashtags + image alt text. Going over 300 will return a `Record/description must not be longer than 300 graphemes` error.","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":15,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Tom Sekula","username":"tsekula","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/b8b7167fcca1eaa6f34161bc1dc7d5b21edb402424fa5d10c606006ebafcf3b3?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2562,"template_name":"Simple Bluesky multi-image post using native Bluesky API","unique_visitors":355,"unique_weekly_visitors":28,"unique_monthly_visitors":46,"unique_inserters":62,"unique_weekly_inserters":8,"unique_monthly_inserters":12},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2564","wf_detais":{"id":2564,"name":"Automatically promote your YouTube video on X","createdAt":"2024-11-21T21:26:34.300Z","description":"# YouTube to X Post\n\n## Overview\n\nThis **n8n workflow** automates the process of promoting your latest YouTube videos on **X (formerly Twitter)**.

For each query, it triggers a sub-workflow dedicated to handling the scraping tasks.\n\n### Scrapes Google Maps for URLs\nUsing these queries, the workflow scrapes Google Maps to collect URLs of business listings matching the provided criteria.\n\n### Fetches HTML Content\nThe workflow then fetches the HTML pages of the collected URLs for further processing.\n\n### Extracts Emails\n\nUsing a Code Node with custom JavaScript, the workflow runs regular expressions on the HTML content to extract business email addresses.\n\n## Setup\n1. **Add Queries:**\nOpen the first node, \"Run Workflow\" and input a list of queries, each containing the business keywords and the target region.\n\n2. **Configure the Google Sheets Node:**\nOpen the Google Sheets node and select a document and specific sheet where the scraped results will be saved.\n\n3. **Run the workflow**:\nClick on \"Test workflow\" and watch your Google Sheets document gradually receive business email addresses. \n\n## Customize as Needed:\n\nYou can adjust the regular expressions in the Code Node to refine the email extraction logic or add logic to extract other kinds of information.","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":26,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":8},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.removeDuplicates":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Akram Kadri","username":"akramkadri","bio":"AI Automation Consultant | Freelancer","verified":false,"links":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/akram-kadri/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e57785a112fbcca1ac70d537a9ed5c5a68be59f808ed8b36475bde0e2c8f384b?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2567,"template_name":"Scrape business emails from Google Maps without the use of any third party APIs","unique_visitors":5039,"unique_weekly_visitors":263,"unique_monthly_visitors":450,"unique_inserters":1757,"unique_weekly_inserters":90,"unique_monthly_inserters":158},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2568","wf_detais":{"id":2568,"name":"Upsert huge documents in a vector store with Supabase and Notion","createdAt":"2024-11-24T18:37:24.868Z","description":"## Purpose\n\nThis workflow adds the capability to build a RAG on living data. In this case Notion is used as a Knowledge Base. Whenever a page is updated, the embeddings get upserted in a Supabase Vector Store.\n\nIt can also be fairly easily adapted to PGVector, Pinecone, or Qdrant by using a custom HTTP request for the latter two.\n\n## Demo\n\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ELAxebGmspY/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ELAxebGmspY)\n\n## How it works\n\n- A trigger checks every minute for changes in the Notion Database. The manual polling approach improves accuracy and prevents changes from being lost between cached polling intervals.\n- Afterwards every updated page is processed sequentially\n- The Vector Database is searched using the Notion Page ID stored in the metadata of each embedding. If old entries exist, they are deleted.\n- All blocks of the Notion Database Page are retrieved and combined into a single string\n- The content is embedded and split into chunks if necessary.

This example can be used in a variety of contexts where figuring out what is and isn't relevant can save a lot of time for your organisation.\n\n## How it works\n* We start with a form trigger which asks for the purpose of the appointment.\n* Instantly, we can qualify this by using a text classifier node which uses AI's contextual understanding to ensure the appointment is worthwhile. If not, an alternative is suggested instead.\n* Multi-page forms are then used to set the terms of the appointment and ask the user for a desired date and time.\n* An acknowledgement is sent to the user while an approval by email process is triggered in the background.\n* In a subworkflow, we use Gmail with the wait for approval operation to send an approval form to the admin user who can either confirm or decline the appointment request.\n* When approved, a Google Calendar event is created. When declined, the user is notified  via email that the appointment request was declined.\n\n## How to use\n* Modify the enquiry classifier to determine which contexts are relevant to you.\n* Configure the wait for approval node to send to an email address which is accessible to all appropriate team members.\n\n## Requirements\n* OpenAI for LLM\n* Gmail for Email\n* Google Calendar for Appointments\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* Not using Google Mail or Calendar?

Google Sheet is used for demonstration purposes but this could be any database.\n* Multi-page forms allow you to continue the onboarding experience with a short survey. 3 form nodes are chained to capture more details from the user which update the same row in the google sheet.\n* Finally, a form ending node shows a customised completion screen for our user.\n\nCheck out the example sheet here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W1PiFjCoiEBHHKKCRVMLmpKg4AWIy9w1dQ2Dq8qxPs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W1PiFjCoiEBHHKKCRVMLmpKg4AWIy9w1dQ2Dq8qxPs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## How to use\n* Keeping forms simple may serve to increase form completion rates. If you feel the need to add additional fields, consider breaking them up into more forms and group them contextually.\n\n## Requirements\n* Google Sheets for data capture\n* Slack for notifications\n\nFeel free to swap these out for services that you use!\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* Play with multi-form design to maximise the opportunity of getting to know the user better. That said, lengthy flows are likely to put people off.\n* Instead of showing a static completion screen, perhaps redirecting to your blog or other more interesting page.","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":12,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.form":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.slack":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Jimleuk","username":"jimleuk","bio":"Freelance consultant based in the UK specialising in AI-powered automations.

We used the workflow tool in the [previous Telegram template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2035-telegram-ai-bot-with-langchain-nodes/) to call the Dalle-3 model.\n\nIn the new version, we've achieved similar results using the HTTP Request tool and the Telegram node tool instead. The main difference is that Telegram bot becomes more flexible. The LangChain Agent node can decide which tool to use and when. In the previous version, all steps inside the custom workflow tool were executed sequentially.\n\n⚠️ Note that you'd need to select the Tools Agent to work with new tools. \n\nBefore launching the template, make sure to set up your OpenAI and Telegram credentials.\n\nHere’s how the new Telegram bot works:\n\n1. Telegram Trigger listens for new messages in a specified Telegram chat. This node activates the rest of the workflow after receiving a message.\n\n2. AI Tool Agent receives input text, processes it using the OpenAI model and replies to a user. It addresses users by name and sends image links when an image is requested.\n\n3. The OpenAI GPT-4o model generates context-aware responses. You can configure the model parameters or swap this node entirely. \n\n4.  Window buffer memory helps maintain context across conversations. It stores the last 10 interactions and ensures that the agent can access previous messages within a session. Conversations from different users are stored in different buffers.\n\n5. The HTTP request tool connects with OpenAI's DALL-E-3 API to generate images based on user prompts. The tool is called when the user asks for an image.\n\n6. Telegram node tool sends generated images back to the user in a Telegram chat. It retrieves the image from the URL returned by the DALL-E-3 model. This does not happen directly, however. The response from the HTTP request tool is first stored in the Agent’s scratchpad (think of it as a short-term memory). In the next iteration, the Agent sends the updated response to the GPT model once again. The GPT model will then create a new tool request to send the image back to the user. To pass the image URL, the tool uses the [new $fromAI() expression](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/). \n\n7. Send final reply node sends the final response message created by the agent back to the user on Telegram. Even though the image was already passed to the user, the Agent always stops with the final response that comes from dedicated output.\n\n⚠️ Note, that the Agent may not adhere to the same sequence of actions in 100% of situations. For example, sometimes it could skip sending the file via the Telegram node tool and instead just send an URL in the final reply. If you have a longer series of predefined steps, it may be better to use the “old” custom workflow tool.\n\nThis template is perfect as a starting point for building AI agentic workflow.

Once complete, the reference is saved into the newly created row.\n\n**Check out the example Airtable here** - [https://airtable.com/appfP15Xd0aVZR9xV/shrGFgXLyQ4Jg58SU](https://airtable.com/appfP15Xd0aVZR9xV/shrGFgXLyQ4Jg58SU)\n\n## How to use\n* The n8n form is autogenerated which means you only need provide access to the table.

By leveraging YouTube's search and data APIs, it gathers and analyzes video performance metrics from the past two days to provide insights into what content is gaining traction. Here's how the workflow operates:\n\n1. **Trigger Setup**: The workflow begins when a user sends a query through the `chat_message_received` node. If no niche is provided, the AI prompts the user to select or input one.\n\n2. **AI Agent (Language Model)**: The central node utilizes a GPT-based AI agent to:\n   - Understand the user's niche or content preferences.\n   - Generate tailored search terms related to the niche.\n   - Process YouTube API responses and summarize trends using insights such as common themes, tags, and audience engagement metrics (views, likes, and comments).\n\n3. **YouTube Search**: The `youtube_search` node runs a secondary workflow to query YouTube for relevant videos published within the last two days. It retrieves basic video data such as video IDs, relevance scores, and publication dates.\n\n4. **Video Details Retrieval**: The workflow fetches additional details for each video:\n   - **Video Snippet**: Metadata like title, description, and tags.\n   - **Video Statistics**: Metrics such as views, likes, and comments.\n   - **Content Details**: Video duration, ensuring only content longer than 3 minutes and 30 seconds is analyzed.\n\n5. **Data Processing**:\n   - Video metadata is cleaned, sanitized, and stored in memory.\n   - Tags, titles, and descriptions are analyzed to identify patterns and trends across multiple videos.\n\n6. **Output**: The workflow compiles insights and presents them to the user, highlighting:\n   - The most common themes or patterns within the niche.\n   - URLs to trending videos and their respective channels.\n   - Engagement statistics, helping the user understand the popularity of the content.\n\n### Key Notes for Setup:\n- **API Keys**: Ensure valid YouTube API credentials are configured in the `get_videos`, `find_video_snippet`, `find_video_statistics`, and `find_video_data` nodes.\n- **Memory Buffer**: The `window_buffer_memory` node ensures the AI agent retains context during analysis, enhancing the quality of the generated insights.\n- **Search Term Customization**: The AI agent dynamically creates search terms based on the user’s niche to improve search precision.\n\n### Use Case:\nThis workflow is ideal for YouTubers or marketers seeking data-driven inspiration for creating content that aligns with current trends, maximizing the potential to engage their audience.\n\n### Example Output:\nFor the niche \"digital marketing\":\n- Trending Topic: Videos about \"mental triggers\" and \"psychological marketing.\"\n- Tags: \"SEO,\" \"Conversion Rates,\" \"Social Proof.\"\n- Engagement: Videos with over **200K views** and high likes/comment ratios are leading trends.\n- Video links:\n  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=video_id1\n  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=video_id2","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":18,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.youTube":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolWorkflow":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Leonardo Grigorio","username":"leonardogrig","bio":"I combine my full-stack development expertise with AI automation using n8n, creating scalable workflows and seamless integrations for smarter business solutions.","verified":false,"links":["https://x.com/leonardogrig"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2bb981acd7d0e27410fb1aa4f7989788741d6faafc4e173f69847ec5e5f30e88?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2606,"template_name":"AI Youtube Trend Finder Based On Niche","unique_visitors":2360,"unique_weekly_visitors":126,"unique_monthly_visitors":209,"unique_inserters":621,"unique_weekly_inserters":36,"unique_monthly_inserters":59},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2607","wf_detais":{"id":2607,"name":"Research AI Agent Team with auto citations using OpenRouter and Perplexity","createdAt":"2024-12-05T04:31:18.702Z","description":"**Purpose of workflow:**\nThis AI-powered workflow is designed to automatically generate comprehensive, well-researched articles on any given topic.

It's particularly beneficial for those who need quick contextual information retrieval from text-heavy files stored in Supabase, without needing additional services like Google Drive.\n\n### What problem does this workflow solve?\nManually retrieving and analyzing specific information from large document repositories is time-consuming and inefficient. This workflow automates the process by vectorizing documents and enabling AI-powered interactions, making it easy to query and retrieve context-based information from uploaded files.\n\n### What this workflow does\nThe workflow integrates Supabase with an AI-powered chatbot to process, store, and query text and PDF files. The steps include:\n- Fetching and comparing files to avoid duplicate processing.\n- Handling file downloads and extracting content based on the file type.\n- Converting documents into vectorized data for contextual information retrieval.\n- Storing and querying vectorized data from a Supabase vector store.\n\n1. **File Extraction and Processing**: Automates handling of multiple file formats (e.g., PDFs, text files), and extracts document content.\n2. **Vectorized Embeddings Creation**: Generates embeddings for processed data to enable AI-driven interactions.\n3. **Dynamic Data Querying**: Allows users to query their document repository conversationally using a chatbot.\n\n### Setup\n\n#### N8N Workflow\n1. **Fetch File List from Supabase**:\n   - Use Supabase to retrieve the stored file list from a specified bucket.\n   - Add logic to manage empty folder placeholders returned by Supabase, avoiding incorrect processing.\n\n2. **Compare and Filter Files**:\n   - Aggregate the files retrieved from storage and compare them to the existing list in the Supabase `files` table.\n   - Exclude duplicates and skip placeholder files to ensure only unprocessed files are handled.\n\n3. **Handle File Downloads**:\n   - Download new files using detailed storage configurations for public/private access.\n   - Adjust the storage settings and GET requests to match your Supabase setup.\n\n4. **File Type Processing**:\n   - Use a Switch node to target specific file types (e.g., PDFs or text files).\n   - Employ relevant tools to process the content:\n     - For PDFs, extract embedded content.\n     - For text files, directly process the text data.\n\n5. **Content Chunking**:\n   - Break large text data into smaller chunks using the Text Splitter node.\n   - Define chunk size (default: 500 tokens) and overlap to retain necessary context across chunks.\n\n6. **Vector Embedding Creation**:\n   - Generate vectorized embeddings for the processed content using OpenAI's embedding tools.\n   - Ensure metadata, such as file ID, is included for easy data retrieval.\n\n7. **Store Vectorized Data**:\n   - Save the vectorized information into a dedicated Supabase vector store.\n   - Use the default schema and table provided by Supabase for seamless setup.\n\n8. **AI Chatbot Integration**:\n   - Add a chatbot node to handle user input and retrieve relevant document chunks.\n   - Use metadata like file ID for targeted queries, especially when multiple documents are involved.\n\n### Testing\n- Upload sample files to your Supabase bucket.\n- Verify if files are processed and stored successfully in the vector store.\n- Ask simple conversational questions about your documents using the chatbot (e.g., \"What does Chapter 1 say about the Roman Empire?\").\n- Test for accuracy and contextual relevance of retrieved results.","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":33,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.supabase":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":11},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolVectorStore":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStoreSupabase":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Mark Shcherbakov","username":"lowcodingdev","bio":"I am a business analyst with a development background, dedicated to helping small businesses and entrepreneurs leverage cloud services for increased efficiency.

Built with **AI-powered components**, the workflow leverages **semantic query generation, result re-ranking, and real-time reporting** to deliver actionable insights.\n\nIt is particularly well-suited for **real-time data retrieval**, **market research**, and any domain requiring automated yet customizable search result processing.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n\n1. **Webhook Integration for Input**:  \n   - The workflow begins with a **Webhook Node** that captures the user's search query as input, enabling seamless integration with other systems.  \n\n2. **Step 1: Semantic Query Generation** (Powered by \"Semantic Search - Query Maker\"):  \n   - Using AI (Google Gemini), the initial query is refined and transformed into a **context-aware, expert-level search query**.  \n   - The process ensures that the search engine retrieves the most relevant and precise results.\n\n3. **Step 2: Web Search Execution**:  \n   - A free Brave Search API processes the refined query to fetch search results, ensuring speed and cost efficiency.\n\n4. **Step 3: Semantic Re-Ranking of Results** (Powered by \"Semantic Search - Result Re-Ranker\"):  \n   - The workflow reranks the search results based on relevance to the original question, prioritizing the most relevant URLs dynamically.  \n   - Results are passed through **AI-powered intelligent reranking** to ensure the final output reflects optimal relevance and quality.\n\n5. **Step 4: Structured Output Generation**:  \n   - Results are converted into a well-structured, organized JSON format, ranking the **top 10 search results** with their titles, links, and descriptions.  \n   - Missing ranks (if fewer than 10 results) are handled gracefully with placeholders, ensuring consistency.\n\n6. **Step 5: Real-Time Reporting**:  \n   - The reranked search results are sent back to the user or integrated system via the Webhook Node in a **JSON-formatted response**.  \n   - Reports are highly structured and ready for downstream processing or consumption.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Features**\n\n1. **AI-Powered Query Refinement**:  \n   - Transforms basic queries into detailed, expert-level search terms for optimal results.\n\n2. **Dual-Stage Semantic Search**:  \n   - Combines **query generation** and **result reranking** for precise, high-relevance outputs.\n\n3. **Top 10 Result Reranking**:  \n   - Dynamically ranks and organizes the top 10 results based on semantic relevance to the query.\n\n4. **Customizable Integration**:  \n   - Fully modifiable for alternative APIs or integrations, such as other search engines or custom ranking logic.\n\n5. **JSON-Formatted Structured Results**:  \n   - Outputs reranked results in a standardized format, ideal for integration into systems requiring machine-readable data.\n\n6. **Webhook-Based Flexibility**:  \n   - Works seamlessly with Webhook inputs for easy deployment in diverse workflows.\n\n7. **Cost-Effective API Usage**:  \n   - Pre-integrated with the free Brave Search API, minimizing operational costs while delivering accurate search results.\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions for API Setup**\n\n1. **Brave Search API**:  \n   - Visit [api.search.brave.com](https://api.search.brave.com) to obtain a free-tier API key for web search.  \n2. **AI Integration** (Google Gemini):  \n   - Visit Google AI Studio and generate an API key for semantic query generation and reranking.  \n3. **Webhook Configuration**:  \n   - Set up the input Webhook to capture search queries and the output Webhook to deliver reranked results.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Choose This Workflow?**\n\n- **Precision and Relevance**: Combines AI-based query generation with advanced reranking for accurate results.  \n- **Fully Customizable**: Easily adapt the workflow to alternative APIs, search engines, or ranking logic.  \n- **Real-Time Insights**: Provides structured, real-time output ready for immediate use.  \n- **Scalable and Modular**: Ideal for businesses, researchers, and data analysts needing a robust, repeatable solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Tags**  \nAI Workflow, Semantic Search, Query Refinement, Search Result Reranking, Real-Time Search, Web Search Automation, Google Search, Brave Search, News Search, API Integration, Market Research, Competitive Intelligence, Business Intelligence,Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, GPT, LLM\n","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":20,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.dateTime":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatAnthropic":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatGoogleGemini":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserAutofixing":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputParserStructured":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Mind-Front","username":"mind-front","bio":"**Mind-Front** is a pilot project hosted at (https://www.mindfront.solutions), delivering intelligent, data-driven market reports to support strategic decision-making. \n\nTo help the n8n community, we’re sharing workflow solutions that address common automation challenges.

For optimal output, theme topics relevant to your brand.\n\n## Requirements\n* A source of text-heavy content is required to accurately breakdown the brand voice and article style. Don't have your own? Maybe try your competitors?\n* OpenAI for LLM - though I recommend exploring other models which may give subjectively better results.\n* Wordpress for blog but feel free to use other preferred publishing platforms.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* Ideally, you'd want to \"train\" your agent on material which is similar to your output ie. your social media post may not get the best results from your blog content due to differing formats.\n* Typically, this brand voice extraction exercise should run once and then be cached somewhere for reuse later.

In this demo, we've asked for the AI to identify all bunnies.\n* The coordinates are then rescaled with the original image's width and height to correctl align them.\n* Finally to measure the accuracy of the object detection, we use the \"Edit Image\" node to draw the bounding boxes onto the original image.\n\n## How to use\n* Really up to the imagination! Perhaps a form of grounding for evidence based workflows or a higher form of image search can be built.\n\n## Requirements\n* Google Gemini for LLM\n\n## Customising the workflow\n* This template is just a demonstration of an experimental version of Gemini 2.0.

An API key is not required since the workflow parses publicly available data.\n\n#### Step 3: AI Integration\n- Verify the connection to the AI model used for report generation. Supported models include Google Gemini and OpenAI.\n- Note that the system can be customized by modifying the provided prompt to suit specific analysis needs.\n\n#### Step 4: Testing\n- Run a sample test with a YouTube video ID to ensure subtitles are correctly retrieved and the report is generated successfully.\n\n---\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\n- **Effortless Content Analysis:** Generate thematic reports with minimal setup.\n- **No API Key Dependency:** Simplified access by leveraging YouTube’s public HTML.\n- **Actionable Insights:** Gain valuable information on video content for business, research, or personal projects.\n- **Cost Considerations:** The execution cost depends primarily on the model used and the length of the video (affecting token usage). Leveraging the free tier of Google Gemini models is recommended to minimize costs.\n- **Main Theme Extraction:** The default prompt excludes irrelevant promotional content, providing clear and focused thematic summaries.\n\nEstimated setup time: 15–20 minutes with a ready environment.\n\n---\n\n### Prompt Description\n\nThe workflow includes a customizable prompt used to process subtitles in XML format and generate analytical reports. The generated report includes:\n\n1. **Title:** A brief phrase capturing the essence of the main theme.\n2. **Body:** An analytical description of the main theme, structured into a maximum of three concise paragraphs. It focuses on summarizing key ideas, recurring themes, and connections without referencing the source explicitly (e.g., avoiding phrases like “this video”). The system also removes content related to sales, subscriptions, or promotions to maintain a clear thematic focus.\n\n---\n\n### Example Output\n\n**Title:** The Ethical Challenges of Artificial Intelligence  \n\n**Report:**  \nArtificial intelligence presents significant challenges in areas such as privacy, fairness, and automated decision-making. Its implementation in critical sectors such as healthcare, justice, and security has sparked debates about inherent biases and lack of transparency. Additionally, there is growing concern over the ethical implications of automation, including its impact on employment and the global economy.

By intercepting user requests, sourcing real-time exchange rate data via Google search results, and formatting the data into actionable responses, it obviates the reliance on third-party APIs. This efficiency renders it an indispensable instrument for diverse applications, including dynamic pricing strategies for AI-driven systems, financial data automation, and real-time currency computation within complex workflows. The workflow's architectural simplicity ensures seamless integration across professional and academic domains, optimizing both scalability and reliability.\n\n**Workflow Steps:**\n1. **Capture Conversion Query:**\n   - The workflow initiates by intercepting user input delivered as a GET request through a configured webhook. Inputs should adhere to a structured syntax, such as `5usd to mxn`, to ensure flawless processing.\n   - *Testing Tip:* Use tools like Postman or a browser to test GET requests and verify that the Webhook receives inputs correctly.\n2. **Fetch Exchange Rate:**\n   - Utilizing the HTTP Request node, a Google search query is executed to retrieve current exchange rate data. This method ensures the workflow remains economical and adaptable while circumventing API dependencies.\n3. **Extract Conversion Data:**\n   - By processing the returned HTML from Google's search results, this node extracts precise exchange rate figures and contextual information critical for accurate conversions.\n   - *Error Handling:* If extraction fails, verify that the input format is correct and update CSS selectors to reflect any changes in Google's HTML structure.\n4. **Format Currency Response:**\n   - The extracted data undergoes refinement and is formatted into a structured, user-friendly string that conveys the conversion results with clarity and precision.\n5. **Send Conversion Response:**\n   - The workflow culminates by dispatching the formatted response back to the request origin, completing the loop with efficiency and reliability.\n\n**Required Configuration:**\n- Configure the Webhook node to accommodate GET requests. The query parameters should follow the format: `https://your-webhook-url/currency-converter?q=5usd+to+mxn`.\n- Inputs must adhere strictly to the predefined syntax (e.g., `5usd to mxn`). Deviations may induce processing errors or yield erroneous outputs.\n\n**Customization Options:**\n- The **Extract Conversion Data** node’s CSS selectors can be fine-tuned to align with modifications in Google’s HTML structure, ensuring long-term operability.\n- Adjustments to the **Format Currency Response** node enable bespoke output formatting, incorporating additional metadata or altering the response structure to meet specific project requisites.\n\n**Advanced Features:**\n- This workflow’s modular design supports seamless integration into expansive systems. For instance, an e-commerce platform could employ it to dynamically localize product pricing based on user geolocation.\n- Enhanced functionality can be achieved by appending nodes to log conversions, monitor performance metrics, or trigger auxiliary workflows conditioned on conversion outputs.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n- For a query like `5usd to mxn`, the workflow generates a response formatted as: `5 USD = 95 MXN`. This output is optimized for readability and practical application.\n\n**Use Case Examples:**\n- **AI Integration:** Enables artificial intelligence agents to process real-time price conversions efficiently across diverse currencies, enhancing their computational capabilities.\n- **Financial Operations:** Automates precise currency conversions for corporate reports, international transactions, and market analytics.\n- **Personal Financial Planning:** Assists users in calculating currency conversions for investment decisions or travel budgeting with minimal manual effort.\n- **E-commerce Applications:** Facilitates dynamic price adjustments on online marketplaces, displaying localized prices to augment user experience and conversion rates.\n- **Workflow Integration:** Embeds seamlessly into larger systems, such as CRMs or ERPs, to streamline financial operations and enhance interoperability.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n- **No API Dependency:** By leveraging publicly available data from Google, the workflow eliminates the complexities and costs associated with API integration, reducing overhead and enhancing accessibility.\n- **Precision and Currency:** Ensures accurate and real-time results by querying Google directly.\n- **Flexibility:** Designed to adapt to various operational contexts and input formats, making it a versatile asset in computational and commercial applications.\n\n**Tags:**\n- `currency conversion`, `automation`, `webhook`, `data extraction`, `AI integration`, `financial automation`, `e-commerce`, `real-time data`, `scalable workflows`.","categories":[{"id":8,"name":"Finance"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":10,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.html":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Mauricio Perera","username":"rckflr","bio":"Automation consultant with over 10 years of experience specializing in AI, no-code, and workflow optimization.

This value is passed to the GraphQL node query as `$('Document').item.json.twitch` so make sure to change this based on your workflow.\n\n## How it Works:\n\nThe important nodes here are the `GrapQL` and `IF` nodes. The GrapQL queries the Twitch API, and then the output returns a document with the `stream` property. The IF node then checks if this property has a value, if `null` means the user is offline, otherwise the user is online or live.\n\n## Common Use Cases:\nYou can use this with other workflow templates to post live stream alerts to Twitter/X, Bluesky, and Discord via webhooks, etc to notify your community to join youR stream. You may also use an `LLM` node to write a custom alert based on the value of property `title`\n\n## How to adjust this template\nIf you want to check a list of Twitch channels, you can simply exchange the `Document` set node in the beginning with your list of channels.\n\n\nFor more information on the GraphQL output please see the official Twitch API documentation: [Get Streams](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/#get-streams)","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":7,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.graphql":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Roger Filomeno","username":"godie","bio":"","verified":false,"links":["https://rogverse.fyi/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/cfa1e61b39623327cd21f885d88e3a3345d1a113e734b473074a2a959512ae61?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2684,"template_name":"Check if a Twitch Stream is Live","unique_visitors":50,"unique_weekly_visitors":3,"unique_monthly_visitors":4,"unique_inserters":11,"unique_weekly_inserters":1,"unique_monthly_inserters":1},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2694","wf_detais":{"id":2694,"name":"SLL Expiry Alert with SSL-Checker.io","createdAt":"2025-01-03T12:28:32.839Z","description":"\n## Use Case\n\nManaging SSL certificates manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, often leading to unexpected downtime or security risks due to expired certificates.\n\n## What This Workflow Does\n\nThis workflow automatically monitors SSL certificates for a list of websites, checks their expiry status using SSL-Checker.io, and sends timely notifications if a certificate is about to expire.\n\n## Setup\nAdd your credentials for Google Sheets, Gmail, and SSL-Checker.io.\n\nCreate a Google Sheet with a list of URLs for the websites you want to monitor.\n\nConfigure the workflow to check the SSL status weekly.\n\nSet up email notifications to alert you when a certificate is close to expiry.\n\nActivate the workflow to automate monitoring and notification.\n\n## How to Adjust It to Your Needs\n\n- Customize the URL Source: Replace Google Sheets with another data source like Airtable or CSV files.\n- Modify Notification Thresholds: Change the expiry threshold (e.g., notify for 14 days instead of 7).\n- Add Additional Actions: Integrate with tools like Slack or Teams for team-wide notifications.\n- Automate Renewal Requests: Add a step to send renewal requests directly to your SSL provider if a certificate is nearing expiry.","categories":[{"id":16,"name":"DevOps"},{"id":28,"name":"IT Ops"},{"id":29,"name":"SecOps"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":12,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Vishal Kumar","username":"vishalquantana","bio":"","verified":false,"links":["https://quantana.com.au/ai/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/19e625b50be6c5e0f734a6e837828341ade4fa64ca3d52321ed95ead0bf4c270?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2694,"template_name":"SSL Expiry Alert with SSL-Checker.io","unique_visitors":961,"unique_weekly_visitors":103,"unique_monthly_visitors":156,"unique_inserters":212,"unique_weekly_inserters":29,"unique_monthly_inserters":41},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2695","wf_detais":{"id":2695,"name":"Generating New Keywords and their Search Volumes using the Google Ads API","createdAt":"2025-01-03T14:59:40.018Z","description":"## Generate new keywords for SEO with the monthly Search volumes\n\nThis workflow is an improvement on the workflows below.

It is designed to handle incoming requests dynamically and return detailed JSON responses for further usage.\n\n### **Overview**\n\nThe workflow processes a product name submitted through a webhook. It fetches the corresponding Product Hunt page, extracts and analyzes inline scripts, and structures the data into a well-defined JSON format using AI tools. The final JSON response is returned to the client through the webhook.\n\n### **Workflow Steps**\n\n#### 1. **Webhook Listener**\n\n- **Node:** Receive Product Request\n- **Function:** Captures incoming requests containing the product name to process.\n- **Details:** Accepts HTTP requests and extracts the `product` parameter from the query string, such as `&lt;custom_webhook_url&gt;/?product=epigram`.\n\n#### 2. **Fetch Product HTML**\n\n- **Node:** Fetch Product HTML\n- **Function:** Sends an HTTP request to retrieve the HTML content of the specified Product Hunt page.\n- **Details:** Constructs a dynamic URL using the product name and fetches the page data.\n\n#### 3. **Extract Inline Scripts**\n\n- **Node:** Extract Inline Scripts\n- **Function:** Parses the HTML content to extract inline scripts located within the `&lt;head&gt;` section.\n- **Details:** Excludes scripts containing `src` attributes and validates the presence of inline scripts.\n\n#### 4. **Process Data with LLM**\n\n- **Node:** Process Script with LLM\n- **Function:** Analyzes the extracted scripts using a language model to identify key product data.\n- **Details:** Processes the script to derive structured and meaningful insights.\n\n#### 5. **Refine Data with Google Gemini**\n\n- **Node:** Analyze Script with Google Gemini\n- **Function:** Leverages Google Gemini AI for enhanced analysis of script data.\n- **Details:** Ensures the extracted data is precise and enriched.\n\n#### 6. **Format Product Data to JSON**\n\n- **Node:** Format Product Data to JSON\n- **Function:** Structures the processed data into a clean JSON format.\n- **Details:** Defines a schema to ensure all relevant fields are included in the output.\n\n#### 7. **Send JSON Response to Client**\n\n- **Node:** Send JSON Response to Client\n- **Function:** Returns the final structured JSON response to the client.\n- **Details:** Sends the response back via the same webhook that initiated the request. For example, `&lt;custom_webhook_url&gt;`.\n\n### **Key Features**\n\n- **Versatile Use Cases:** This workflow can be used to gather Product Hunt data for creating blog posts or as a tool for AI agents to research products efficiently.\n- **Dynamic Processing:** Adapts to various product names through dynamic URL construction.\n- **AI Integration:** Utilizes the Gemini 1.5 8B AI model, offering reduced latency and minimal or no cost depending on the use case.\n- **Selector Independence:** Functions even if Product Hunt's DOM structure changes, as it does not rely on direct DOM selectors.\n- **Reliable Data Output:** A low temperature setting (0) and a precisely defined JSON schema ensure accurate and real data extraction.\n- **Dynamic Processing:** Adapts to various product names through dynamic URL construction.\n- **AI Integration:** Utilizes advanced language models for data extraction and refinement.\n- **Structured Output:** Ensures the output JSON adheres to a predefined schema for consistency.\n- **Error Handling:** Includes validations to handle missing or malformed data gracefully.\n\n### **Customization Options**\n\n### **Limitations**\n- **Dependency on Product Hunt:** Significant changes to the way Product Hunt loads data on its pages might require modifications to the workflow.\n- **Adaptability:** Even if changes occur, the workflow can be updated to maintain functionality due to its reliance on AI and not direct DOM selectors.\n\n\n- Modify the webhook path to suit your application.\n- Adjust the prompt for the language model to include additional fields.\n- Extend the JSON schema to capture more data fields as needed.\n\n### **Expected Output**\n\n**Performance Metrics**\n- **Response Time:** Typically ~6 seconds per product.\n- **Accuracy:** Data extracted with &gt;95% precision due to the pre-defined JSON schema.\n\n\nA JSON object containing detailed information about the specified product.

Built with n8n, OpenAI's LLMs and the Pinecone vector database, it provides accurate and context-aware responses to your questions about how to use the GitHub API.\nYou could adapt this to any OpenAPI specification for any public or private API, thus creating a documentation chatbout that anyone in your company can use.\n\n## How it works:\n\n* Data Ingestion: The workflow fetches the complete GitHub API OpenAPI 3 specification directly from the GitHub repository.\nChunking and Embeddings: It splits the large API spec into smaller, manageable chunks. OpenAI's embedding models then generate vector embeddings for each chunk, capturing their semantic meaning.\n* Vector Database Storage: These embeddings, along with the corresponding text chunks, are stored in a Pinecone vector database.\n* Chat Interface and Query Processing: The workflow provides a simple chat interface. When you ask a question, it generates an embedding for your query using the same OpenAI model.\n* Semantic Search and Retrieval: Pinecone is queried to find the most relevant text chunks from the API spec based on the query embedding.\n* Response Generation: The retrieved chunks and your original question are fed to OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` LLM, which generates a concise, informative, and contextually relevant answer, including code snippets when applicable.\n\n## Set up steps:\n\n* Create accounts: You'll need accounts with OpenAI and Pinecone.\n* API keys: Obtain API keys for both services.\nConfigure credentials: In your n8n environment, configure credentials for OpenAI and Pinecone using your API keys.\n* Import the workflow: Import this workflow into your n8n instance.\n* Pinecone Index: Ensure you have a Pinecone index named \"n8n-demo\" or adjust the workflow accordingly.

In my experience, some developers don't check their Jira board to find out whether there are new updates on the issues or not or if some Issues need to be addressed as soon as possible. So, the developer or anyone else in other fields needs to be informed about the task as soon as possible, too. One way to send this immediate notification is through the Telegram Bot.\n\n**Setup Guide**\n\nso, first of all, you need to register a Telegram Bot in your account and obtain its token, so that we'll be able to send Telegram messages by using this token through our bot;\nafter getting your telegram bot token\n- go to the workflow and click on *one of the telegram nodes*\n- select the telegram credential or create one through the **Credential to connect with** field\n- and put the token in the token in the **Access Token** field.\n\nOk, you're done with the Telegram Side setup.\n\nthen you need the Jira accounts (team users) **accountId** and also their telegram **chatId** for the **telegram account** node so that it can find the corresponding telegram user from the assignee of the issue, put this data as following guide comments in the **telegram account** node.\n\nNow we go for the Jira side setup, you need to setup some **automation rules** as your needs.\n- go to the Jira settings and **Global automation** section, click on the *Create Rule* button\n- select the **Issue Created** trigger type in the *When* step\n- add a **Send webhook request** action, after selecting it you'll see its settings\n- go back to workflow and from the **jira-webhook** node copy the **Production URL** \n- paste it in the **Web request URL** field in the Jira action setting\n- then set the **HTTP method** field on **POST** \n- set **Web request body** on **Issue Data (Automation format)**\n- in the header section, add a new header with the name **type** and value **created** for the creation event.\n\nOK, the Jira side also is done! Now It's time to test!\n\nIf you've put your Jira **accountId** and telegram **chatId** in the **telegram account** node and of course started the telegram bot, after creating an Issue that is assigned to you, the creation notif will send to you in telegram!","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":3}}}},"user":{"name":"Abolfazl Akbarzadeh","username":"abolfazlakbarzadeh","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/9431a7ca6e0b3d3a347f8ce50087c4be7b91a8352be4450dc34897013ba2f171?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2708,"template_name":"Send Jira task notifications to Telegram user via Bot","unique_visitors":174,"unique_weekly_visitors":14,"unique_monthly_visitors":25,"unique_inserters":30,"unique_weekly_inserters":2,"unique_monthly_inserters":7},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2709","wf_detais":{"id":2709,"name":"Automated Email Optin Form with n8n and Hunter io for verification","createdAt":"2025-01-09T05:40:32.489Z","description":"## Case Study 📧\nWant to collect email subscribers without paying expensive monthly fees? 💰 This workflow creates a free email collection system with built-in email verification to ensure you only collect legitimate email addresses! ✨\n\n## Learn more:\n📺 [Watch the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgvEHwu19Rs&t=2s): \n\n📝 [Read the detailed guide](https://rumjahn.com/create-email-capture-forms-for-free-using-n8n-and-sendgrid-and-easily-grow-your-subscriber-list/)\n\n## What this workflow does 🛠️\n- Creates a customizable email collection form that can be embedded on your website 🌐\n- Verifies email addresses using Hunter.io to filter out fake or invalid emails ✅\n- Stores verified email addresses in SendGrid for your email marketing needs 📊\n- Completely free solution (except for Hunter.io's 50 free monthly credits) 🆓\n\n## Setup ⚙️\n1.

Some API’s do not support an endpoint (e.g. Todoist: completed tasks) to do so, which is why you would work with the error branch, only that this does not work well in combination with the retry functionality.\n\n## How it works\n\n- Instead of the builtin retry function of a Node a custom loop is used, to get more granular control in between the iterations\n- If the main executed node fails, the error can be filtered for an expected error, which can trigger a separate action\n- The retries only happen, if an unexpected error happened\n- The workflow only stops, if the defined amount of retries exceeded\n\n## Setup\n\n- Copy the nodes into your existing workflow\n- Replace the “Replace me” placeholder with the Node you want to apply the retry logic on\n- Follow the sticky notes for more instructions and optional settings","categories":[{"id":20,"name":"Building Blocks"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":19,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":9},"n8n-nodes-base.stopAndError":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Mario","username":"octionic","bio":"Workflow Optimization Expert | Software Architect.

It periodically checks for new emails, reads their content, and categorizes them based on existing Gmail labels. If no matching label is found, the workflow creates a new label and assigns it to the email.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Polling for Emails**: The workflow triggers every 5 minutes to check for new emails using the Gmail Trigger node.\n- **Reading Labels**: Existing Gmail labels are fetched to determine the most relevant match for email categorization.\n- **Dynamic Labeling**: If no existing label matches, a new label is created dynamically based on the email's content.\n- **OpenAI Integration**: The workflow uses OpenAI's Chat model to analyze email content and suggest or create appropriate labels.\n- **Email Categorization**: Labels are applied to emails, ensuring they are organized in Gmail's structure. The workflow also removes less relevant emails (e.g., ads) from the inbox.\n\n## Nodes in Use\n1. **Gmail Trigger**: Polls Gmail every 5 minutes for new emails.\n2. **Gmail - Read Labels**: Fetches all existing Gmail labels.\n3. **Gmail - Get Message**: Retrieves the full content of a specific email.\n4. **Gmail - Add Label to Message**: Assigns a chosen label to the email.\n5. **Gmail - Create Label**: Creates a new label if necessary.\n6. **OpenAI Chat Model**: Analyzes email content for categorization.\n7. **Memory Buffer**: Retains context for email analysis across multiple iterations.\n8. **Wait Node**: Adds a buffer period to manage email processing.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- **Gmail API Setup**: Ensure Gmail OAuth2 credentials are configured in n8n.\n- **OpenAI API Key**: Configure OpenAI credentials for email analysis.\n- **Labeling Standards**: Maintain a consistent Gmail label structure for better organization.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Add your Gmail API credentials to the Gmail nodes.\n2. Add your OpenAI API credentials to the OpenAI Chat Model node.\n3. Activate the workflow. It will start polling for new emails every 5 minutes.\n4. Monitor and refine the categorization logic if necessary to ensure alignment with Gmail's organizational needs.\n\n## Use Case\nIdeal for individuals or teams handling high email volumes who want to maintain an organized inbox and automate repetitive categorization tasks.\n\nNote: You can improve the prompt to get better results from the agent by giving it more personal rules on how to categorize.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":13,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.gmailTool":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.gmailTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Martijn Kerver","username":"mkc","bio":"","verified":false,"links":[],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/fe72c50f0c4d39bbfa48922c6996bdb1536d6dfefa73ec881562587bb49fae50?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2740,"template_name":"Basic Automatic Gmail Email Labelling with OpenAI and Gmail API","unique_visitors":513,"unique_weekly_visitors":60,"unique_monthly_visitors":107,"unique_inserters":135,"unique_weekly_inserters":26,"unique_monthly_inserters":45},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2741","wf_detais":{"id":2741,"name":"AI-Powered RAG Workflow For Stock Earnings Report Analysis","createdAt":"2025-01-17T09:45:18.164Z","description":"This n8n workflow creates a financial analysis tool that generates reports on a company's quarterly earnings using the capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, Google's Gemini AI and Pinecone's vector search.

It automatically indexes new or updated documents in a Pinecone vector database, allowing the chatbot to provide accurate and up-to-date information. The workflow uses Google's Gemini AI for both embeddings and response generation.\n\n## How it works\nThe workflow uses two `Google Drive Trigger` nodes: one for detecting new files added to a specified Google Drive folder, and another for detecting file updates in that same folder.\n1. Automated Indexing: When a new or updated document is detected\n2. The `Google Drive` node downloads the file.\n3. The `Default Data Loader` node loads the document content.\n4. The `Recursive Character Text Splitter` node breaks the document into smaller text chunks.\n5. The Embeddings Google Gemini node generates embeddings for each text chunk using the text-embedding-004 model.\n6. The `Pinecone Vector Store` node indexes the text chunks and their embeddings in a specified Pinecone index.\n7.The Chat Trigger node receives user questions through a chat interface. The user's question is passed to an AI Agent node.\n8. The `AI Agent` node uses a `Vector Store Tool` node, linked to a Pinecone Vector Store node in query mode, to retrieve relevant text chunks from Pinecone based on the user's question.\n9. The AI Agent sends the retrieved information and the user's question to the Google Gemini Chat Model (gemini-pro).\n10. The `Google Gemini Chat Model` generates a comprehensive and informative answer based on the retrieved documents.\n11.

In this specific case, we will use a generic \"AI Agent\" node to illustrate that it could use other models from different data providers.\n\n### Enhanced Weather Forecasting\n\nIn this small example, it's easy to demonstrate how to obtain weather forecast results from the Open-Meteo site to accurately display the upcoming days.\n\nThis can be used to plan travel decisions, for example.\n\n## What this workflow does\n\n1. We will make an HTTP request to find out the geographic coordinates of a city.\n2. Then, we will make other HTTP requests to discover the weather for the upcoming days.\n\nIn this workshop, we demonstrate that the AI will be able to determine which tool to call first—it will first call the geolocation tool and then the weather forecast tool.

It streamlines the process of capturing leads, analyzing inquiries, and generating actionable responses. The workflow uses ERPNext to capture inquiries, analyzes them with AI, and notifies the appropriate team or individual, all while maintaining a professional approach.\n\n---\n\n### **What This Template Does**\n1. **ERPNext Webhook Integration:**\n   - Captures leads and inquiries through ERPNext webhooks.\n   - Triggers the workflow when a new lead is created.\n\n2. **AI-Powered Inquiry Analysis:**\n   - Uses AI to extract key details from lead notes (e.g., customer name, organization, inquiry summary).\n   - Classifies inquiries as valid or invalid based on relevance to products, services, or solutions.\n\n3. **Contact Assignment:**\n   - Matches inquiries to the appropriate contact(s) using a Google Sheets database or ERPNext contact information.\n   - Handles multiple contacts if required.\n\n4. **Email Notifications:**\n   - Generates professional email notifications for valid inquiries.\n   - Sends emails to the appropriate contact(s) with inquiry details and action steps.\n\n5. **Invalid Lead Handling:**\n   - Identifies invalid inquiries (e.g., unrelated to products or services) and flags them for follow-up or dismissal.\n\n6. **Custom Email Formatting:**\n   - Converts plain text into professionally formatted HTML emails.\n   - Ensures that communication is clear, concise, and visually appealing.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n\n#### **Step 1: Capture Lead Data**\n- **Webhook in ERPNext:**\n  - Create a webhook in ERPNext for the \"Lead\" DocType.\n  - Set the trigger to `on_insert` to capture new leads in real-time.\n\n- **Lead Details:**\n  - The workflow fetches lead details, including notes, contact information, and the source of the lead.\n\n#### **Step 2: Validate and Analyze Inquiry**\n- **AI Agent for Analysis:**\n  - An AI agent analyzes the lead notes to extract key details and classify the inquiry as valid or invalid.\n  - The analysis includes checking the relevance of the inquiry to products, services, or solutions offered by the company.\n\n- **Invalid Leads:**\n  - If the inquiry is invalid, the workflow flags it and stops further processing.\n\n#### **Step 3: Assign Contact(s)**\n- **Google Sheets Integration:**\n  - Uses a Google Sheets database to map products, services, or solutions to responsible contacts.\n  - Ensures that inquiries are directed to the right person or team.\n\n- **Multiple Contacts:**\n  - Handles cases where multiple contacts are responsible for a particular product or service.\n\n#### **Step 4: Generate and Send Email Notifications**\n- **AI-Generated Emails:**\n  - The workflow generates a professional email summarizing the inquiry.\n  - Emails include details like customer name, organization, inquiry summary, and action steps.\n\n- **Custom HTML Formatting:**\n  - Emails are converted to HTML for a polished and professional appearance.\n\n- **Send Notifications:**\n  - Sends email notifications through Microsoft Outlook or another configured email client.\n  - Optionally, notifies via WhatsApp or SMS for urgent inquiries.\n\n#### **Step 5: Post-Inquiry Actions**\n- **ERPNext Record Updates:**\n  - Updates the lead record in ERPNext with relevant details, including inquiry status and contact information.\n\n---\n\n### **Setup Instructions**\n\n#### **Prerequisites**\n1. **ERPNext:**\n   - A configured ERPNext instance with lead data and a webhook for the \"Lead\" DocType.\n2. **Google Sheets:**\n   - A sheet mapping products, services, or solutions to responsible contacts.\n3. **AI Integration:**\n   - Credentials for OpenAI or other supported AI platforms.\n4. **Email Client:**\n   - Credentials for Microsoft Outlook or another email client.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Setup**\n1. **ERPNext Configuration:**\n   - Create a webhook for the \"Lead\" DocType in ERPNext.\n   - Test the webhook with sample data to ensure proper integration.\n\n2. **Workflow Import:**\n   - Import the workflow template into n8n.\n   - Configure nodes with your API credentials for ERPNext, Google Sheets, and AI tools.\n\n3. **Google Sheets Integration:**\n   - Prepare a Google Sheet with columns for product, service, or solution and the responsible contact(s).\n   - Link the sheet to the workflow.\n\n4. **AI Agent Configuration:**\n   - Customize the AI agent’s prompts to align with your business’s products and services.\n   - Adjust criteria for valid and invalid inquiries as needed.\n\n5. **Email Setup:**\n   - Configure the email client node with your email service credentials.\n   - Customize the email template for your organization.\n\n6. **Testing:**\n   - Run the workflow with sample leads to validate the entire process.\n   - Check email notifications, contact assignments, and record updates in ERPNext.\n\n---\n\n### **Dos and Don’ts**\n\n#### **Dos:**\n- **Test Thoroughly:** Test the workflow with various scenarios before deploying in production.\n- **Secure Credentials:** Keep API and email credentials secure to avoid unauthorized access.\n- **Customize Prompts:** Tailor AI prompts to match your business needs and language style.\n- **Use Professional Email Templates:** Ensure emails are clear and well-formatted.\n\n#### **Don’ts:**\n- **Skip Validation:** Always validate inquiry data to avoid sending irrelevant notifications.\n- **Overload the Workflow:** Avoid adding unnecessary nodes that can slow down processing.\n- **Ignore Errors:** Monitor logs and address errors promptly for a smooth workflow.\n\n---\n\n### **Resources**\n- **YouTube Tutorial:**  \n  Watch the full step-by-step tutorial on setting up this workflow:  \n  [SyncBricks YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@syncbricks)\n\n- **Courses and Training:**  \n  Learn more about ERPNext and AI automation through my comprehensive courses:  \n  [SyncBricks LMS](http://lms.syncbricks.com)\n\n- **Support and Contact:**  \n  -

The workflow will periodically query both sources and use regular expressions and some JavaScript to edit several fields until we have the desired data in the proper format.\n- Once the sources are formatted, we will combine them using the \"Merge\" node.\n- Since the workflow will run twice a day, we will discard items older than two days. This will be achieved using a \"Filter\" node.\n- A \"Sort\" node will arrange the items by publication date so that the most recent ones appear first.\n- To create a flat list in \"Markdown\" format from the resulting items, we will use a small JavaScript function. This function must escape special characters to ensure they are correctly interpreted.\n- Finally, the list will be sent to the appropriate channel using a \"Telegram\" node.\n\n## Configuration Instructions:\n- When opening the workflow for the first time, configure the Telegram credential.\n- In the \"RSS\" nodes, insert the URLs of the sources to query.\n- In the \"Edit Fields\" nodes we will have to adjust the regular expressions to obtain the desired result based on our RSS sources. In this case the expressions have been adjusted to obtain the name, size and link of each published file.\n- In the \"Sort\" node we can modify the maximum age of the elements that we are going to send. In this case, 2 days have been included (2 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 milliseconds) since it is necessary to take into account that Telegram has a maximum message length and if we exceed it, it will return an error instead of sending it.\n- Lastly, include the channel ID in the \"Telegram\" node where the messages will be sent.\n\n\nTemplate was created in n8n v1.72.1","categories":[{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":13,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.sort":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.telegram":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.rssFeedRead":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Sherlockes","username":"sherlockes","bio":"","verified":false,"links":["https://sherblog.es"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/feb9866e71611dc78851ffebfa0ca03c60df5c9f6b718a2e9e735d69a5a8f8c2?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2748,"template_name":"Merge and filter several Rss & send to Telegram","unique_visitors":203,"unique_weekly_visitors":32,"unique_monthly_visitors":59,"unique_inserters":65,"unique_weekly_inserters":10,"unique_monthly_inserters":22},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2764","wf_detais":{"id":2764,"name":"Extract and process information directly from PDF using Claude and Gemini","createdAt":"2025-01-21T07:44:36.708Z","description":"## Overview\n- This workflow helps you compare Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Flash when extracting data from a PDF\n- This workflow extracts and processes the data within a PDF in **one single step**, **instead of calling an OCR and then an LLM”**\n\n\n## How it works\n- The initial 2 steps download the PDF and convert it to base64.\n- This base64 string is then sent to both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Flash to extract information.\n- This workflow is made to let you compare results, latency, and cost (in their dedicated dashboard).\n\n\n## How to use it\n- Set up your Google Drive if not already done\n- Select a document on your Google Drive\n- Modify the prompt in \"Define Prompt\" to extract the information you need and transform it as wanted.\n- Get a [Claude API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) and/or [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)\n- Note that you can deactivate one of the 2 API calls if you don't want to try both\n- Test the Workflow\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":11,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Agent Studio","username":"agentstudio","bio":"We are a product studio that helps organizations leverage no-code and generative AI to automate internal processes and launch new digital products.","verified":true,"links":["https://agentstudio.io/"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e9cf0d0fccead46655b11b2ce215cf14d33ecdaa2ce52828f003574c1800e77a?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2764,"template_name":"Extract and process information directly from PDF using Claude and Gemini","unique_visitors":323,"unique_weekly_visitors":60,"unique_monthly_visitors":105,"unique_inserters":87,"unique_weekly_inserters":19,"unique_monthly_inserters":30},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2765","wf_detais":{"id":2765,"name":"Automated Hugging Face Paper Summary Fetching & Categorization Workflow","createdAt":"2025-01-21T09:33:22.365Z","description":"# **How the Automated Workflow Works**  \n## **Scheduled Fetching from Hugging Face** ⏰  \nThe workflow triggers every weekday at 8 AM, automatically fetching the latest papers from **Hugging Face** for easy access.  \n\n## **Duplication Check to Avoid Redundant Entries** 🔍  \nIt ensures the paper's summary is not already stored in your **Notion** workspace, preventing duplicate records and keeping your database organized.  \n\n## **Content Analysis with OpenAI** 🧠  \nUsing **OpenAI**'s powerful capabilities, the workflow analyzes the fetched paper summary, extracts key insights, and categorizes the content for easier understanding.  \n\n## **Data Storage and Notification Integration** 📥🔔  \nOnce the summary is processed, it's automatically stored in your **Notion** workspace, and a notification containing the paper details is sent to your designated **Slack** channel for quick reference.\n\n---\n\n# **Set Up Your Automated Workflow**  \n## **Create Your n8n Account** 📝  \nStart by registering for an **n8n** account and logging into the [**n8n cloud service**](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/j7p1m1a0ln1d).  \n\n## **Connect OpenAI, Notion, and Slack** 🔗  \nLink your **OpenAI**, **Notion**, and **Slack** accounts by entering the appropriate tokens.

This seriously cuts down on maintainance requirements and is reusable for any number of tables at little cost.\n\n**Check out the video demo I did for n8n Studio here**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fNAD1u8BZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fNAD1u8BZw)\n\n**Check out the example Airtable here:** [https://airtable.com/appAyH3GCBJ56cfXl/shrXzR1Tj99kuQbyL](https://airtable.com/appAyH3GCBJ56cfXl/shrXzR1Tj99kuQbyL)\n\n**Looking for the Baserow Version?** [https://n8n.io/workflows/2780-ai-data-extraction-with-dynamic-prompts-and-baserow/](https://n8n.io/workflows/2780-ai-data-extraction-with-dynamic-prompts-and-baserow/)\n\n## How it works\n* Given we have an \"input\" field for context and a number of fields for the data we want to extract, this template will run in the background to react to any changes to either the \"input\" or fields and automatically update the rows accordingly.\n* The key is that Airtable fields have a special property called the \"field description\". In this pattern, we use this property to allow the user to store a simple prompt describing the data that should exist in the column.\n* Our n8n template reads these column descriptions aka \"prompts\" to use as instructions to perform tasks on the \"input\".\n* In this template, the \"input\" is a PDF of a resume/CV and the columns are attributes a HR person would want to extract from it - such as full name, address, last position, years of experience etc.\n\n## How to use\n* First publish this template and ensure it's accessible via webhook URL.\n* You then have to run the \"create airtable webhooks\" mini-flow to configure your Airtable to send change events to the n8n template. This mini-flow exists in the template but you'll have to update the IDs.\n\nCheck the template for more instructions.\n\n## Requirements\n* Airtable for Tables/Database\n* OpenAI for LLM and extraction. Feel free to choose another LLM if preferred.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* If you're not using files, you can replace the \"input\" field with anything you like. For example, the \"input\" could be single line text.\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":51,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.airtable":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":15},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Jimleuk","username":"jimleuk","bio":"Freelance consultant based in the UK specialising in AI-powered automations.

Using the ID of the task, the trigger is being locked down for 15 seconds.\n- Depending on the detected changes, the other side is updated accordingly.\nGenerally Notion is treaded as the main source. Using an \"Obsolete\" Status, it is guaranteed, that tasks never get deleted entirely by accident.\n- The Todoist ID is stored in the Notion task, so they stay linked together\n- An additional full sync workflow daily fixes inconsistencies, if any of them occurred, since webhooks cannot be trusted entirely.\n- Since Todoist requires a more complex setup, a tiny workflow helps with activating the webhook.\n- Another tiny workflow helps generating a global config, which is used by all workflows for mapping purposes.\n\n## Mapping (Notion &gt;&gt; Todoist)\n\n- Name: Task Name\n- Priority: Priority (1: do first, 2: urgent, 3: important, 4: unset)\n- Due: Date\n- Status: Section (Done: completed, Obsolete: deleted)\n- &lt;page_link&gt;: Description (read-only)\n- Todoist ID: &lt;task_id&gt;\n\n## Current limitations\n\n- Changes on the same task cannot be made simultaneously in both systems within a 15-20 second time frame\n- Subtasks are not linked automatically to their parent yet\n- Recurring tasks are not supported yet\n- Tasks names do not support URL’s yet\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Notion\n- A database must already exist (get a basic template [here](https://steadfast-banjo-d1f.notion.site/17682b476c848086b002de766879aa71)) with the following properties (case matters!):\n  - Text: \"Name\"\n  - Status: \"Status\", containing at least the options \"Backlog\", \"In progress\", \"Done\", \"Obsolete\"\n  - Select: \"Priority\", containing the options \"do first\", \"urgent\", \"important\"\n  - Date: \"Due\"\n  - Checkbox: \"Focus\"\n  - Text: \"Todoist ID\"\n### Todoist\n- A project must already exist with the same sections like defined as Status in Notion (except Done and Obsolete)\n### Redis\n- Create a [Free Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/try-free/) instance or self-host\n\n\n## Setup\n\n[![setup video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/73jhyU0t4c4/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/73jhyU0t4c4)\n\n*The setup involves quite a lot of steps, yet many of them can be automated for business internal purposes.*\n\nJust follow the video or do the following steps:\n- Setup credentials for Notion (access token), Todoist (access token) and Redis - you can also create empty credentials and populate these later during further setup\n- Clone this workflow by clicking the \"Use workflow\" button and then choosing your n8n instance - otherwise you need to map the credentials of many nodes.\n- Follow the instructions described within the bundle of sticky notes on the top left of the workflow\n\n\n## How to use\n\n- You can apply changes (create, update, delete) to tasks both in Notion and Todoist which then get synced over within a couple of seconds (this is handled by the differential realtime sync)\n- The daily running full sync, resolves possible discrepancies in Todoist and sends a summary via email, if anything needed to be updated. In case that contains an unintended change, you can jump to the Task from the email directly to fix it manually.","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":15,"name":"Design"},{"id":17,"name":"HR"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"},{"id":27,"name":"Marketing"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":246,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":18},"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":22},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":17},"n8n-nodes-base.form":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.html":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.wait":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.gmail":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.merge":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.redis":{"count":11},"n8n-nodes-base.crypto":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":17},"n8n-nodes-base.notion":{"count":15},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.todoist":{"count":12},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":72},"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":12},"n8n-nodes-base.stopAndError":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.executionData":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.compareDatasets":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflow":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Mario","username":"octionic","bio":"Workflow Optimization Expert | Software Architect.

This seriously cuts down on maintainance requirements and is reusable for any number of tables at little cost.\n\n**Check out the n8n Studio Episode here**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fNAD1u8BZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fNAD1u8BZw)\n\n**Community post here**: [https://community.n8n.io/t/dynamic-prompts-with-n8n-baserow-and-airtable/72052](https://community.n8n.io/t/dynamic-prompts-with-n8n-baserow-and-airtable/72052)\n\n\n**Looking for the Airtable Version?** [https://n8n.io/workflows/2771-ai-data-extraction-with-dynamic-prompts-and-airtable/](https://n8n.io/workflows/2771-ai-data-extraction-with-dynamic-prompts-and-airtable/)\n\n\n## How it works\n* Given we have an \"input\" field for context and a number of fields for the data we want to extract, this template will run in the background to react to any changes to either the \"input\" or fields and automatically update the rows accordingly.\n* The key is that Baserow fields have a special property called the \"field description\". In this pattern, we use this property to allow the user to store a simple prompt describing the data that should exist in the column.\n* Our n8n template reads these column descriptions aka \"prompts\" to use as instructions to perform tasks on the \"input\".\n* In this template, the \"input\" is a PDF of a resume/CV and the columns are attributes a HR person would want to extract from it - such as full name, address, last position, years of experience etc.\n\n## How to use\n* First publish this template and ensure it's accessible via webhook URL.\n* You then have to complete the \"create Baserow webhooks\" steps to configure your baserow to send change events to the n8n template. Baserow webhooks are created in the Baserow web interface.\n\nCheck the template for more instructions.\n\n## Requirements\n* Baserow for Tables/Database\n* OpenAI for LLM and extraction. Feel free to choose another LLM if preferred.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* If you're not using files, you can replace the \"input\" field with anything you like. For example, the \"input\" could be single line text.\n","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":45,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.code":{"count":3},"n8n-nodes-base.noOp":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.switch":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.splitOut":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":15},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":7},"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.extractFromFile":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":2}}}},"user":{"name":"Jimleuk","username":"jimleuk","bio":"Freelance consultant based in the UK specialising in AI-powered automations.

It handles two scenarios:  \n1. **Product Search**: Extracts user intent (keywords, price ranges, SKUs) and fetches matching products from WooCommerce.  \n2. **General Inquiries**: Answers store-related questions (e.g., opening hours, policies) using RAG and documents stored in Google Drive.  \n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**  \n\n#### **1. Chat Interaction & Intent Detection**  \n- **Chat Trigger**:  \n  - Starts when a user sends a message (*\"When chat message received\"*).  \n- **Information Extractor**:  \n  - Uses OpenAI to analyze the message and determine if the user is **searching for a product** or asking a **general question**.  \n  - Extracts:  \n    - `search` (true/false).  \n    - `keyword`, `priceRange`, `SKU`, `category` (if product-related).  \n  - Example:  \n    ```json  \n    {  \n      \"search\": true,  \n      \"keyword\": \"red handbags\",  \n      \"priceRange\": { \"min\": 50, \"max\": 100 },  \n      \"SKU\": \"BAG123\",  \n      \"category\": \"women's accessories\"  \n    }  \n    ```  \n\n#### **2. Product Search (WooCommerce Integration)**  \n- **AI Agent**:  \n  - If `search: true`, routes the request to the `personal_shopper` tool.  \n  - **WooCommerce Node**:  \n    - Queries the WooCommerce store using extracted parameters (`keyword`, `priceRange`, `SKU`).  \n    - Filters products in stock (`stockStatus: \"instock\"`).  \n    - Returns matching products (e.g., \"red handbags under €100\").  \n\n#### **3. General Inquiries (RAG System)**  \n- **RAG Tool**:  \n  - If `search: false`, uses the **Qdrant Vector Store** to retrieve store information from documents.  \n  - **Google Drive Integration**:  \n    - Documents (e.g., store policies, FAQs) are stored in Google Drive.  \n    - Downloaded, split into chunks, and embedded into Qdrant for semantic search.  \n  - **OpenAI Chat Model**: Generates answers based on retrieved documents (e.g., \"Our store opens at 9 AM\").  \n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n\n#### **1. Configure the RAG System**  \n- **Google Drive Setup**:  \n  - Upload store documents .  \n  - Update the **Google Drive2** node with your folder ID.  \n- **Qdrant Vector Database**:  \n  - Clean the collection (update **Qdrant Vector Store** node with your URL).  \n  - Use **Embeddings OpenAI** to convert documents into vectors.  \n\n#### **2. Configure OpenAI & WooCommerce**  \n- **OpenAI Credentials**:  \n  - Add your API key to all OpenAI nodes (`OpenAI Chat Model`, `Embeddings OpenAI`, etc.).  \n- **WooCommerce Integration**:  \n  - Connect your WooCommerce store (credentials in the `personal_shopper` node).  \n  - Ensure product data is synced and accessible.  \n\n#### **3. Customize the AI Agent**  \n- **Intent Detection**:  \n  - Modify the **Information Extractor**’s system prompt to align with your store’s terminology.  \n- **RAG Responses**:  \n  - Update the tool description to reflect your store’s documents.  \n\n---\n\n### **Notes**  \nThis template is ideal for e-commerce businesses needing a hybrid assistant for product discovery and customer support.","categories":[{"id":2,"name":"Sales"},{"id":18,"name":"Product"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":25,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.set":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":4},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.wooCommerceTool":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":3},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolCalculator":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolVectorStore":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStoreQdrant":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.informationExtractor":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterTokenSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"n3w Italia","username":"n3witalia","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["https://n3w.it"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/d41b8a0aa81139243509c58870f5b4be292824a507ab57d10ed066d8628ed8da?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2784,"template_name":"Personal Shopper Chatbot for WooCommerce with RAG using Google Drive and openAI ","unique_visitors":1046,"unique_weekly_visitors":135,"unique_monthly_visitors":236,"unique_inserters":158,"unique_weekly_inserters":28,"unique_monthly_inserters":43},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2785","wf_detais":{"id":2785,"name":"RSS Feed News Processing and Distribution Workflow","createdAt":"2025-01-23T16:39:37.327Z","description":"### Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is designed for professionals and teams who need to monitor multiple RSS feeds, filter the latest content, and distribute actionable updates as a Trello comment.

It triggers whenever a new page is created, capturing the page's metadata.\n\n**Notion - Retrieve Page Content:** Once triggered, the automation fetches the full content of the newly added Notion page, including blocks like text, images, and videos.\n\n**Filter Non-Text Content:** The next step filters out non-text content (such as images and videos), ensuring only textual content is processed.\n\n**Summarize - Concatenate Notion's blocks content:** The remaining text content is concatenated into a single block of text for easier processing.\n\n**Token Splitter:** The concatenated text is then split into manageable tokens, which are chunks of text that can be used for embedding.\n\n**Create metadata and load content:** Metadata such as the page ID, creation time, and title are added to the content, making it easy to reference and track.\n\n**Embeddings Google Gemini:** The processed text is passed through a Google Gemini model to generate embeddings, which are numerical representations of the text that capture its semantic meaning.\n\n**Pinecone Vector Store:** Finally, the embeddings, along with the content and metadata, are stored in a Pinecone vector store, making it searchable and ready for use in applications like document retrieval or natural language processing tasks.\n\nThis workflow ensures that every new page added to the Notion database is processed into a format that can be easily searched and used in machine learning applications. The automation runs every minute to capture new data in real-time, providing an up-to-date and searchable vector database of Notion content.\n\n**Use Case:**\n\nThis automation converts Notion pages into vector embeddings and stores them in Pinecone for enhanced search and AI-driven insights. It’s ideal for teams using Notion for knowledge management, enabling semantic search and context-based content retrieval. For example, employees can easily find relevant information across documents, and data scientists can use AI models to analyze and summarize the content stored in Notion.","categories":[{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"},{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":8,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.filter":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.notion":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.summarize":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.notionTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStorePinecone":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsGoogleGemini":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterTokenSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"Udit Rawat","username":"ailistmaster","bio":"Hi, I’m Udit, an Acquia-certified developer with a strong background in web development and creating enterprise solutions.

Below is a detailed analysis of what each node in the workflow does:\n\n---\n### **How It Works**\n1. **Triggering the Workflow**:\n   - The workflow starts with a **Manual Trigger** node, which is activated when the user clicks \"Test workflow\" in the n8n interface.\n\n2. **Fetching Data**:\n   - The **Get Ideas** node retrieves data from a Google Sheets document. It reads a specific sheet and filters the data based on the \"ID POST\" column, returning the first matching row.\n\n3. **Setting the Prompt**:\n   - The **Set your prompt** node extracts the `PROMPT` field from the Google Sheets data and assigns it to a variable for use in subsequent steps.\n\n4. **Generating Content**:\n   - The **Generate article** node uses an AI model (DeepSeek) to create an SEO-friendly article based on the prompt. The article includes an introduction, 2-3 chapters, and a conclusion, formatted in HTML.\n   - The **Generate title** node uses the same AI model to generate a concise, SEO-optimized title for the article.\n\n5. **Publishing on WordPress**:\n   - The **Create post on WordPress** node creates a new draft post on WordPress using the generated title and article content.\n\n6. **Generating and Uploading an Image**:\n   - The **Generate Image** node creates a photorealistic image based on the article title using an AI model (OpenAI).\n   - The **Upload image** node uploads the generated image to WordPress as a media file.\n   - The **Set Image** node assigns the uploaded image as the featured image for the WordPress post.\n\n7. **Updating Google Sheets**:\n   - The **Update Sheet** node updates the original Google Sheets document with the post details, including the title, post ID, creation date, and row number.\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n1. **Configure Google Sheets Integration**:\n   - Set up the **Google Sheets** node to connect to your Google account and specify the document ID and sheet name to read from and update.\n\n2. **Set Up AI Models**:\n   - Configure the **OpenAI** nodes (for generating the article, title, and image) with the appropriate API credentials and model settings (e.g., `deepseek-reasoner` for text generation).\n\n3. **Configure WordPress Integration**:\n   - Set up the **WordPress** node with your WordPress site's API credentials to allow creating posts and uploading media.\n\n4. **Define the Prompt and Content Structure**:\n   - In the **Set your prompt** node, ensure the `prompt` variable is correctly mapped to the data from Google Sheets.\n   - In the **Generate article** and **Generate title** nodes, define the instructions for the AI model to generate the desired content.\n\n5. **Set Up Image Generation**:\n   - Configure the **Generate Image** node with the appropriate prompt and image settings (e.g., size, quality, style).\n\n6. **Configure HTTP Requests for Media Upload**:\n   - Set up the **Upload image** and **Set Image** nodes to use the WordPress REST API for uploading and assigning the featured image.\n\n7. **Map Data for Google Sheets Update**:\n   - In the **Update Sheet** node, map the relevant fields (e.g., title, post ID, date) to the appropriate columns in the Google Sheets document.\n\n8. **Test and Activate the Workflow**:\n   - Run the workflow manually to ensure all steps execute correctly.\n   - Once verified, activate the workflow for automated execution.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall purpose of the workflow**\nThis workflow automates the creation of SEO-friendly content for a WordPress blog. Starting from a prompt extracted from a Google Sheets document, it generates an article, a title, and an image, publishes the post on WordPress, and updates the Google Sheets document with the details of the created post.

This ensures that the AI provides accurate and professional responses based on the knowledge base.\n4. **Knowledge Base Utilization**: The AI Agent references a knowledge base stored in Qdrant, a vector database. Documents from Google Drive are downloaded, vectorized using OpenAI embeddings, and stored in Qdrant for retrieval during conversations.\n5. **Response Generation**: The AI Agent generates a response using the OpenAI chat model (gpt-4o-mini) and sends it back to the user via WhatsApp.\n\n---\n\n### Set up steps:\n1. **Create Qdrant Collection**:\n   - Update the `QDRANTURL` and `COLLECTION` variables in the workflow.\n   - Use the *Create collection* HTTP request node to initialize the collection in Qdrant.\n\n2. **Vectorize Documents**:\n   - Configure the *Get folder* and *Download Files* nodes to fetch documents from a specified Google Drive folder.\n   - Use the *Embeddings OpenAI* node to generate embeddings for the downloaded files.\n   - Store the vectorized documents in Qdrant using the *Qdrant Vector Store* node.\n\n3. **Configure Webhooks**:\n   - Ensure both *Verify* and *Respond* webhooks have the same URL.\n   - Set the *Verify* webhook to use the GET HTTP method and the *Respond* webhook to use the POST HTTP method.\n\n4. **Set Up AI Agent**:\n   - Define the system prompt for the AI Agent, specifying guidelines for product information, technical support, customer service, and knowledge base usage.\n   - Link the AI Agent to the OpenAI chat model and configure any additional tools as needed.\n\n5. **Test Workflow**:\n   - Trigger the workflow manually using the *When clicking ‘Test workflow’* node to ensure all components are functioning correctly.\n   - Monitor the flow of data through the nodes and verify that responses are being generated and sent accurately.\n\nBy following these steps, the workflow will be fully operational, enabling a robust AI-powered chatbot capable of handling customer inquiries via WhatsApp.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":24,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.if":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.whatsApp":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":6},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsOpenAi":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStoreQdrant":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterTokenSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"n3w Italia","username":"n3witalia","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["https://n3w.it"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/d41b8a0aa81139243509c58870f5b4be292824a507ab57d10ed066d8628ed8da?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2845,"template_name":"Complete business WhatsApp AI-Powered RAG Chatbot using OpenAI","unique_visitors":65,"unique_weekly_visitors":65,"unique_monthly_visitors":65,"unique_inserters":8,"unique_weekly_inserters":8,"unique_monthly_inserters":8},{"template_url":"https://n8n.io/workflows/2846","wf_detais":{"id":2846,"name":"AI Voice Chatbot with ElevenLabs & OpenAI for Customer Service and Restaurants","createdAt":"2025-02-04T13:13:55.888Z","description":"The \"Voice RAG Chatbot with ElevenLabs and OpenAI\" workflow in n8n is designed to create an interactive voice-based chatbot system that leverages both text and voice inputs for providing information. Ideal for shops, commercial activities and restaurants\n\n### How it works:\n\nHere's how it operates:\n\n1. **Webhook Activation**: The process begins when a user interacts with the voice agent set up on ElevenLabs, triggering a webhook in n8n. This webhook sends a question from the user to the AI Agent node.\n2. **AI Agent Processing**: Upon receiving the query, the AI Agent node processes the input using predefined prompts and tools. It extracts relevant information from the knowledge base stored within the Qdrant vector database.\n3. **Knowledge Base Retrieval**: The Vector Store Tool node interfaces with the Qdrant Vector Store to retrieve pertinent documents or data segments matching the user’s query.\n4. **Text Generation**: Using the retrieved information, the OpenAI Chat Model generates a coherent response tailored to the user’s question.\n5. **Response Delivery**: The generated response is sent back through another webhook to ElevenLabs, where it is converted into speech and delivered audibly to the user.\n6. **Continuous Interaction**: For ongoing conversations, the Window Buffer Memory ensures context retention by maintaining a history of interactions, enhancing the conversational flow.\n\n### Set up steps:\n\nTo configure this workflow effectively, follow these detailed setup instructions:\n\n1. **ElevenLabs Agent Creation**:\n   - Begin by creating an agent on ElevenLabs (e.g., named 'test_n8n').\n   - Customize the first message and define the system prompt specific to your use case, such as portraying a character like a waiter at \"Pizzeria da Michele\".\n   - Add a Webhook tool labeled 'test_chatbot_elevenlabs' configured to receive questions via POST requests.\n\n2. **Qdrant Collection Initialization**:\n   - Utilize the HTTP Request nodes ('Create collection' and 'Refresh collection') to initialize and clear existing collections in Qdrant. Ensure you update placeholders `QDRANTURL` and `COLLECTION` accordingly.\n\n3. **Document Vectorization**:\n   - Use Google Drive integration to fetch documents from a designated folder. These documents are then downloaded and processed for embedding.\n   - Employ the Embeddings OpenAI node to generate embeddings for the downloaded files before storing them into Qdrant via the Qdrant Vector Store node.\n\n4. **AI Agent Configuration**:\n   - Define the system prompt for the AI Agent node which guides its behavior and responses based on the nature of queries expected (e.g., product details, troubleshooting tips).\n   - Link necessary models and tools including OpenAI language models and memory buffers to enhance interaction quality.\n\n5. **Testing Workflow**:\n   - Execute test runs of the entire workflow by clicking 'Test workflow' in n8n alongside initiating tests on the ElevenLabs side to confirm all components interact seamlessly.\n   - Monitor logs and outputs closely during testing phases to ensure accurate data flow between systems.\n\n6. **Integration with Website**:\n   - Finally, integrate the chatbot widget onto your business website replacing placeholder AGENT_ID with the actual identifier created earlier on ElevenLabs.\n\nBy adhering to these comprehensive guidelines, users can successfully deploy a sophisticated voice-driven chatbot capable of delivering precise answers utilizing advanced retrieval-augmented generation techniques powered by OpenAI and ElevenLabs technologies.","categories":[{"id":25,"name":"AI"}],"workflowInfo":{"nodeCount":23,"nodeTypes":{"n8n-nodes-base.webhook":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote":{"count":5},"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest":{"count":2},"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent":{"count":1},"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolVectorStore":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsOpenAi":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorStoreQdrant":{"count":2},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentDefaultDataLoader":{"count":1},"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.textSplitterTokenSplitter":{"count":1}}}},"user":{"name":"n3w Italia","username":"n3witalia","bio":"","verified":true,"links":["https://n3w.it"],"avatar":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/d41b8a0aa81139243509c58870f5b4be292824a507ab57d10ed066d8628ed8da?r=pg&d=retro&size=200"},"template_id":2846,"template_name":"AI Voice Chatbot with ElevenLabs & OpenAI for Customer Service and Restaurants","unique_visitors":66,"unique_weekly_visitors":66,"unique_monthly_visitors":66,"unique_inserters":11,"unique_weekly_inserters":11,"unique_monthly_inserters":11}]
